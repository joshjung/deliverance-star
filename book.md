# Preface

Grieving people drifted into the small sanctuary at the Kansas City mortuary, talking to their loved ones in hushed tones. Up front, an open casket held a young woman, considerable makeup hiding the gunshot wound that had taken her life. Kids and adults alike grappled to comprehend the horror of what had happened, and few in the room knew the long-term effects the murder would have on hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people. Nobody could have anticipated the unfolding story’s potential to reach tens of thousands of people. Even more importantly, few present – including me – were aware of what was occurring in the spiritual realm that weekend.

Only twelve years old, as I entered the room, I felt a new, heavy sensation. I interpreted this as deep spiritual tension. My Christian family and extended relatives were present, but so too was a group of black-leather-clad friends of Anastasia—the young woman in the casket. The eulogy was to be delivered my uncle Dan, who was well-known for running a local homeless ministry, the Kansas City Union Mission, and it could be safely assumed that the message of his eulogy would be related to the Christian faith. Clearly, based on their attitude and even some giggles and snickers, Anastasia’s friends were mustering as much of an air of defiance as they could. Everything felt off.

It was Halloween weekend of 1997 and this was the funeral for Anastasia Witbols-Feugen, my father’s cousin. I had no clue that what transpired would lead to what some still consider an unsolved murder. Despite the court later declaring a young man guilty, people still investigate Anastasia’s murder decades later. I have vivid memories of the few days surrounding that funeral, but one stands out more than any other.

My family chose a pew on the left side of the sanctuary, maybe six to eight rows from the back, and I sat down by myself while my parents and siblings finished their conversations. Wanting to be as respectful as possible, I quietly observed what was going on, soaking in every detail to answer the questions bombarding my brain. Was the murderer present? How did the morticians cover up the shotgun wound so neatly? I felt that the seriousness of this event was paramount. At this point, my Christian faith was new, having been baptized only a few months before, but I struggled to interpret the cold heaviness on my soul. There must be more going on behind the scenes spiritually.

Surveying the crowd of mourners, my attention was captured by one man, who was surrounded by several seductively dressed women in their teens. Odd attire for a funeral! He seemed old to me, even though he must have been no older than twenty. Based on what I observed, he was clearly a leader among a group of Anastasia’s friends. He seemed to be smiling an awful lot for a funeral, and the young women were giving him a lot of attention. Something about that group rubbed me the wrong way. I remember a couple of the girls giggling in response to seeing the casket. But this man above all had a dark air about him. He was four or five pews in front of me, facing the front of the sanctuary. As I stared at the back of his head, I had the very distinct thought run through my head, That man is very evil. 

Immediately and without hesitation, he turned around and glared straight into my eyes, shrugged his shoulders, and mouthed the word What?

Startled, I turned around to see who he was looking at—I did not believe that he was looking at me. But there was nobody between me and the back of the sanctuary who was even remotely looking his way. I turned back to him, and he caught my eyes for a second time, shrugged, and mouthed the word What? Then, he lightly smiled and turned to face the front of the sanctuary, while I shrunk terrified into the pew.

# Chapter 1 - What Is This Book?

In the past few years, despite secularism being quite strong in the west, curiosity about spiritual beings and extraterrestrial life has risen. Many of us have had profound and undeniable experiences and are left with no choice but to accept that—at the very least—the theory that humans are floating alone on a planet in a vast, empty universe does not fit the data. And yet, the data is often sparse, blurry, and subjective. Therefore, evidence of non-terrestrial life rarely satisfies any scientific testing.

Yet a belief that we are not alone in the universe has been the default position of humans for most of history. Cultures worldwide have ancient stories of non-terrestrial beings visiting them long ago and giving them wisdom or a basic jump-start kit on how to live. The names given to these beings may vary, but the stories of their impact—whether fictional or real—ripple through nearly every culture. Media regularly references stories of ancient gods or reimagines our lives if we were not alone in the universe. A part of humanity craves the idea that we are not alone.

But ancient stories often contain language barriers that hinder clear interpretation. The Hebrew language uses the word mal’akh (מַלְאָךְ), which means “messenger,” to describe these beings. Our modern English equivalent is the word angel, which usually conjures images of white beings in wings. But the word mal’akh does not indicate the species of being bringing the message. A human, an alien, or a spiritual being from God’s throne room could all be called “angels” if they are bringing a message. Likewise, many ancient visions using descriptive words like “throne”, “torch”, “eye”, “wing”, or “sword” that might have been chosen because they were the closest words available in their language for what they were seeing. Maybe what they saw would be described quite differently using our much larger vocabulary or perhaps what they were seeing was what something else wanted them to see because it was what they could comprehend! Because of linguistic barriers and the fuzzy and terse descriptions of these beings in ancient texts, it is incredibly difficult to sort out which parts of their reports are intended to be taken literally. This entire topic is often so muddied even among academics that it is just easier to interpret all the stories as myth.

In some cases, ancient stories are intentionally fiction but they morph over time into something more. For example, in the epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey, the ancient Greek writer Homer  wove together tales from oral tradition of ancient heroes, and of gods and their interactions with mankind. These stories are highly embellished retellings of potential historic events, but over time some of their mythological elements were accepted as reality. Hero cults emerged and some of the characters were treated as divine. Over time, the way people communicate stories to each other leaves lots of room for error and centuries later it can become nearly impossible to distinguish myth from fact. Skeptics eventually claim that the entire narrative is legendary.

For all recorded history, intellectual battles have raged between faithful believers and skeptics and agnostics across every area of religious thought. The endless barrage of arguments about faith claims can cause mental exhaustion and a general skepticism toward any supernatural stories. Millions of paranormal and supernatural stories can be found on the internet, exacerbating the fatigue. As a software engineer involved in the sciences, the default posture among most of my tech-driven peers was an assumption that if something cannot be proven in a lab then it probably can be dismissed.

By my thirties, I considered myself a well-studied atheist who spent considerable time keeping up on the latest scientific discoveries. I checked the latest science news daily and regularly read white papers to keep my mind fresh. Most things in life had a trivial explanation to me. Evolutionary biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, anthropology, psychology and similar fields made sense of nearly everything in the world—including paranormal and religious experiences.

Even subjective conscious experiences like beauty, pleasure, and love were entirely natural to me. These sensations were natural outcomes of living creatures experiencing less anxiety and more happiness in the presence of a healthy and safe environment. As biology and physics predict, all life will pursue an environment that maximizes its self-preservation and health, and good feelings are chemical and electrical signals when a part of the environment meets that criteria. Family values and the safety of a religious environment are predictable and natural as well. Organized religions and cults are simply sets of beliefs that feel good by promising a safer environment for resource acquisition and human reproduction.

Unfortunately, every part of nature can contain deception, and the promises made by religions and cults are sometimes unhealthy, unsafe, and downright false. Humans, like every other organism, can be mistaken or deceived by our senses. Like having an allergy or an auto-immune disorder, people sometimes overreact to perceived threats. As a result, we humans form paranoid and delusional beliefs that lead to us to form cults or wage religious wars. We are greedy, ignorant, and self-interested and sometimes do the most atrocious acts against our own environment, even to our own harm. I reassured myself that evil is not a moral thing that exists in some spiritual dimension, but it is simply stupidity and mental illness. After all, many animal species engage in behaviors that seem evil. Observe a gang of primates who tear their neighboring tribe to pieces or look at animals that stupidly eat their own offspring. Religious beliefs may provide comfort and stability, but comfort can be deceptive. A healthy culture, I concluded, should set up guardrails to discourage these delusions. Like taking an antihistamine, societies need to enforce a culture of education and laws to keep their people from destroying themselves with ignorance and delusions.

I believed that if humanity was highly educated and we properly treated mental illness, then nearly all religious beliefs would die off naturally. Spirits are not real, and when one experiences something spiritual, they are just having a mental episode. After much study, I had concluded that religion was nothing more than a complex web of mental lapses, misunderstandings and intentional deceptions. To me, the supernatural or paranormal were nothing more than the brain erroring out, like an artificial intelligence algorithm missing a street stop sign or, perhaps more correctly, seeing a stop sign where one does not exist. Our brains, like a giant artificial intelligence algorithm, were sometimes finding patterns where a pattern does not exist. We just need better training data, that is all.

I was so wrong. And I was about to learn this lesson the hardest way possible when something showed up and pointed me in the last direction I ever wanted to go.

# Chapter 2 - Early Years

I was born in Hutchinson, Kansas, in 1985. When I was around two years old, we moved to the “big city” of Wichita, where I spent my childhood in the Riverside area of town near the Arkansas River. Wichita is exceptionally flat—we used to joke that the highest point in town was the city landfill—and in the 1990s was slow and traditional. Despite encouraging a simple life, Wichita was full of an entrepreneurial spirit. It spawned White Castle, Pizza Hut, and nearly every Boeing 737 fuselage ever created. While not a tourist destination, people who visited Wichita usually commented on how nice everyone was. Kansas has a special charm of calm and humility.

Given that the landscape of Kansas is flat and unexciting, we were forced to be creative from an early age to avoid boredom. The scene in The Wizard of Oz where Dorothy is so overstimulated by her adventures that she cannot wait to get back home to Kansas is accurate. It might have been flat and boring, but it was also quiet, predictable, and secure. There is truly no place like home.

Both my parents had moved to Kansas from Wisconsin, where they had grown up in small towns. My dad’s father, Frederik Jung, graduated from Wheaton College and became a Protestant Christian pastor. My dad’s mother, Lois, grew up the daughter of Christian missionaries in Africa and, when I was a child, would occasionally bust out a story or two from the World War II era of their adventures out on the mission field in Africa. My mom’s dad was known to be a struggling alcoholic who died of cancer when I was a baby. As for my maternal grandmother, Jean, I remember the growing concern among family members that she was becoming more and more a recluse who was exhibiting symptoms of some form of mental illness.

Poverty was a theme in both my parents’ childhoods. My mother grew up in a tiny and poorly insulated house in Wisconsin with eight siblings. They often had little food. Her father worked for the railroad and barely made enough for himself and his wife, let alone their nine kids. The children relied on a massive garden and the occasional poaching of deer, ducks, or whatever game might be roaming the backwoods of Wisconsin. The story goes that my grandfather would often spend money on alcohol, leaving little for the children. However, the eight siblings disagreed over what was most to blame for the situation. My mom’s mom mostly stayed at home with the kids when they weren’t at school but was reported to often be deeply emotionally disturbed. Regardless of the reasons, theirs was an extremely difficult childhood.

My dad’s parents were also poor, although not quite as poor as my mom’s. Grandpa Jung had given up a formal liberal arts education to dedicate his life to God and become a pastor. This decision was apparently such a shock to his successful Freemason father that he was disowned. My grandpa had a near-photographic memory. Funnily enough, one of my aunts said she thought my grandpa was bluffing about his knowledge when she first met him, until he put her suspicion to rest by easily demonstrating his massive knowledge about virtually every topic under the sun by locating it in specific locations in specific books from his library. Both of my dad’s parents supplemented a pastoral income by selling their art. Grandpa Frederik was a black-and-white photographer, and Grandma Lois was an incredible pen-and-ink artist, until she began losing her eyesight and the steadiness of her hands, which forced her to switch to pastels. The two would often travel to shows together to sell their photography and artwork.

Because my grandpa was a loved pastor in my parent’s childhood hometown and my grandmother grew up a child of missionaries in Africa, the default position of everyone in my extended family was conservative Protestant Christian. Anything that helped bolster those beliefs was encouraged.

From my earliest days, I recall having a heightened sense of the spiritual. At the time, I did not realize that my sense of it was unusual. Growing up in conservative Protestant churches, I daily heard about theological topics, about Jesus being sent from heaven to die for our sins, and about his resurrection. We were repeatedly reminded that faith is the only way to salvation, that works could never get us there—like the “lost” Catholics believed. I can remember traveling missionaries telling stories of the devil’s influence in places like Africa and South America through witchcraft. In contrast to these stories, I remember being taught that America was founded as a Christian nation, and the impression I received was that we had advanced past those ancient errors. We were taught that our Christian culture was being attacked more by modern science and postmodernism than by witchcraft or spells. I recall hearing some stories about Ouija boards, haunted houses, and demonic encounters within the United States, but these were rare. As a result, when I began to have spiritual experiences, I felt like a fish out of water.

Despite these experiences, as a child, I had many little intellectual discoveries that laid the groundwork for my later deconversion into atheism.

Like many people, I deeply connected with the epic themes and archetypes of the suffering hero and the villain. So, at an early age, I was drawn into stories like C. S. Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia and J. R. R. Tolkien’s epic The Lord of the Rings. Of course, it helped that the film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy was released during my formative years. There was an aura of profound comfort in the idea that the tapestry of our lives might serve a higher purpose if we submitted ourselves to fighting for the good. The allegorical connections between Aslan and Aragorn sacrificing their life for the good just as Jesus did were not lost on me.

I can remember thinking how cool it was that C. S. Lewis could invent the entire world of Narnia, yet I was disappointed that a world like Narnia contained so many elements that were familiar in our world. After all, Narnia had humans and trees and crops and swords, and even the fictitious creatures were just a mix-and-matching of creatures that exist in real life. Put hooves and horns on a human and call it a fawn . This mixing and matching was fun, but was it possible to invent an entire world from scratch?

I tried super hard to think of nothing—an empty space, a void. Try it right now! Think of literally nothing. And then invent a brand-new world that pulls no ideas from our own. When I tried, I immediately thought of an empty planet—and my frustration rose. Planets are not a new thing. So let us try to think of an existence that does not start with a planet. Maybe a giant flat plane? This does not work either, because anything that involves multidimensional space already exists. Any shape we can think about is informed by our experience in this world. I quickly discovered it was impossible to invent a new imaginary world without pulling ideas from our experiences. There is no such thing as a truly new creative invention, because all inventions are a mixing and matching of things and concepts that we engage with in this life. I remember feeling sad at this discovery, but this little mental experiment laid groundwork which would influence me to discard a belief in heaven which I will address in a future chapter.

One experience planted a seed to be less trustful of supernatural reports and would directly tie in to something that would occur nearly twenty years later. When I was maybe ten or so, my family went to Guadalupe Mountains National Park. While there, I remember my dad talking about the nearby town of Roswell and making lighthearted conversation about UFOs and secret government spy planes. Perhaps we would see one!

One night in our giant family tent, I remember my parents waking me and my brothers up with a startle: “Kids, wake up and look out the tent! Look at that star!”

As my eyes adjusted to the light, I saw a hexagon-shaped “star” hovering in the sky. Shining out from it were six equidistant bright flares of light. The star hovered completely silent and still, not moving the tiniest amount.

We watched it for some time, until we realized it was not changing shape or position in the slightest. My parents mused that maybe it was a secret government craft and would return to base at some point. Eventually, we all fell back asleep.

Later, as my dad and I left the tent to walk to the camp bathroom, we looked back up in the sky—and the six-pointed star was gone! But inside the tent, my mom and siblings were saying it was still there. Inside the tent, they could see it and outside we could not.

After some confusion, we deduced that one star in the sky was just the right size so that its light interacted with the space between the tent screen grid in such a way as to produce those outward bands of light – but only from inside the tent. It was such a strange incident, as only one star was the perfect size to produce this effect.

I filed this event away as a valuable lesson: it is quite easy to misinterpret natural things as paranormal. You must always keep looking for better explanations or you might be deceived. If my family had woken up after the sun’s light had hidden that star, we might have been telling a UFO story for the rest of our lives. Instead, we now had a story we rarely spoke about again.

So, I concluded that perhaps all UFO stories are just misinterpretations of other natural phenomena. Maybe other supernatural or paranormal stories were just misunderstandings too? But we knew for sure that the supernatural stories within Christianity were trustworthy! Or were they?

# Chapter 3 – Devil in the Playground

Around the age of eight, I had my first spiritual dream. The dream opened with me in a park in what felt like Wichita, playing normal kid's games. The park was nestled along a river like the Arkansas River, next to an embankment that dropped down toward the water. I can remember my feeling of bliss as I played with dozens of kids on the equipment and none of us had a care in the world. We felt safe and completely free.

But I quickly became aware of a white line on that ground that was surrounding the park—a line of both protection and prohibition. It was protecting us from something outside the park, but it was also prohibited for us to cross that line. Along the embankment toward the river, maybe a hundred yards from the line, there was a small lean-to hut made of old gray stone. In that hut, the devil was angrily working on something. He would continually look up to see what all of us in the park were doing. I knew intuitively that he hated us and that the white line was protecting us from his coming into the park. If we stayed inside the white ring, we would be safe.

I remember walking up to the white line to watch the devil, who would occasionally come out of his little workshop to pace up and down near the park, eyeing us kids. Considering myself to be quite agile, I got the idea of running across the white line, taunting the devil from a distance, and then, when he got enraged and chased me, quickly crossing back into the safety of the park. He would stand absolutely infuriated on the outside of the white line, glaring at me, while I laughed at my little prank and took pride in showing off to my friends. This was fun. Sure, the white line was forbidden to cross, but what could possibly go wrong so long as I was quick enough to avoid the devil’s grasp?

My antics of teasing the devil went on for quite some time. Then I went back to playing with the other children on the playground. Suddenly, I looked up and noticed the sun setting. In a flash, I remembered another rule I had ignored. That rule stated that as soon as the sun sets, the white line would no longer protect us in the park and the devil could cross it and come grab whomever he wanted.

As soon as I remembered this rule, I turned rapidly toward the embankment, only to see the devil marching straight toward me with a wide, twisted, evil grin on his face. No longer restrained, he marched over the white line into the park. Of all the kids, I was the one he wanted. There was nowhere for me to run. I knew I was done for, and he reached over and put his hand on my shoulder.

At this point, the environment of the dream shifted. There was no longer any park, no longer any sky, and no longer any other kids. It was just me and the devil—and my dad. My dad walked up and calmly asked the devil what was going on. The devil responded candidly and confidently that the law allowed him to seize whomever he wanted after the sun had set, and he wanted me. Now that he had me, he could do whatever he wanted with me. Dread crept over me. I knew that the devil was completely within his rights, and I had no defense for my actions. I had crossed that white line even though I knew it was wrong to do so.

The dream shifted again, and it was no longer my dad talking to the devil. My dad was not present at all! In his place was a strong, darker-skinned man with his shirtless back to me. His curly hair fell past his shoulders, and he was sweating drops of blood—clearly in mental and emotional agony. I do not remember seeing the front of his face. I simply heard this man say, “Don’t take Josh; take me instead.”

At those words, I woke up. It was still quite early in the morning, but I gingerly walked downstairs so as not to wake up any of my family members and just sat on the living room couch. I was dumbfounded and completely emotionally overwhelmed by what this dream communicated. The man was obviously Jesus, as I knew that sweating drops of blood was something the Bible claimed to have happened to Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. I remember feeling an intense sensation that God had shown me something completely profound. I had a dream that explained what Jesus had done for all of humanity, and not just humanity, but for me.

# Chapter 4 - Early Faith

In my uneducated way, I began to pursue God through prayer, Bible reading, and attempting to comprehend the supernatural. I was as serious as a child could possibly be, telling God over and over that I wanted to do whatever he wanted me to do with my life.

Simultaneously, I observed that my dad was beginning to take his faith more seriously. After the death of my dad’s father, I remember my dad dove heavily into both running the bicycle shop that he owned and engaging in a study of the Bible and Christianity in general. You might recall that Grandpa Jung was the first Christian on that side of the family and that he devoted his life to being a pastor. I remember my dad would spend hours poring through books about creation versus evolution. He purchased several books by authors who contributed to Answers in Genesis, a Protestant apologetics ministry that advocates young earth creationism. I also remember him reading Darwin’s Black Box by Michael Behe and a book by Hugh Ross, an astrophysicist turned Christian apologist who has argued for an integration of evolutionary science and faith. I thumbed through these books and may have read one or two. At the time, I implicitly accepted young earth creationism, because obviously the idea life came from nothing is wrong. I even had a “letter to the editor” published in an Answers in Genesis magazine.

During this time, my dad encouraged me and my siblings to read the entire Bible. To encourage us, he made a household rule that we could not play our allotted hour of computer games until we had first read the Bible for half an hour. Obviously, we wanted to play video games, so, assuming we read for half an hour each day, we would end up reading the Bible for over a hundred and fifty hours per year! My dad also printed an Excel spreadsheet that listed every book of the Bible and included an empty box for each chapter in those books. Each time we read a chapter, we could mark it off the spreadsheet, and once we completed reading the entire Bible, we earned a prize. 

Reading the Bible was mostly a slog, if I am honest. I did want to take my faith seriously, but I was having a hard time understanding most of it. Repeatedly, I would read and reread a passage. If you start in Genesis and just plow through the text, there are a few fun stories for a kid—like the story of Joseph and his coat of many colors or Jesus healing ill people—but genealogies, sacrifice rituals, and Hebrew poetry are not exactly kid material. I can remember loathing Leviticus and the lengthy genealogies of Chronicles, feeling perplexed that these texts were considered “God’s Word”.

One deeply impactful story was that of King Solomon as a child, when God visits him in a dream and offers him anything he wants. Young Solomon chooses wisdom to rule the people in his care. I remember being profoundly influenced by the idea that a little kid, given this opportunity to ask for anything, would choose something that impressed God. I, too, wanted wisdom, so I asked God for it. I remember telling him that it was the main thing I wanted in life.

Another time, I remember reading Galatians on a bed in our upstairs northeastern bedroom. The warm sun was throwing long, intense shadows across the room, leaving me in a somewhat dreamy state. I cannot remember the exact passage I was reading, but I remember being suddenly overwhelmed with a sensation of God’s presence and of the purest joy I have ever felt in my life. It was intoxicating. In that moment, I was so unbelievably certain of God’s love for me and that I was His child. All I wanted was to grow up and tell everyone in the world just how wonderful Jesus truly was!

In addition to reading, I was memorizing hundreds of Bible verses for church programs. In my early teens, I earned a prize for quoting 250 Bible verses back-to-back without a single mistake. I even set out at one point to memorize the book of Mark. I made it several chapters before giving up.

While reading and memorizing, questions began piling up in the back of my mind—questions that I felt were not being addressed at church. You may have noticed that some church leaders often present a softened version of Bible stories, skipping difficult parts or taking verses or passages that have a plain yet thorny meaning and then adjusting them to fit a more mainstream narrative. Having read the entire Bible multiple times by my early teens, I noticed this, and it frustrated me.

Why do women not cover their hair in church, even though Paul explicitly instructs them to do so? Why does the Old Testament consider it unclean to have a wet dream? Why did it suddenly become okay in the New Testament to eat every food? What are all these powerful spiritual gifts that are talked about in the Bible, like prophecy and speaking in tongues, and where are they now? What does it mean to deny Christ, and how can you possibly know you are really saved and going to heaven? Why do some verses say you can lose your salvation, but others seem to indicate the opposite? And on and on and on.

One Sunday, riding home from First Evangelical Free Church in Wichita, a thought occurred to me. As we passed a lot of other churches returning from our church all the way across town, I wondered why, for efficiency's sake, we didn’t attend one of the churches closer to home. Why were there so many churches in the first place? When I asked my parents about this, they gave me a general answer about how many Christians think differently but we should not judge them for it. Their answer puzzled me.

Another time, I remember asking my dad how we could possibly know we are right about the meaning of life. After all, there are lots of other types of churches. How in the world can we know whether our views are correct?

My dad acknowledged that my questions were good ones, and then he referred me to a book that sat on the bottom shelf of our dining room bookshelf. I can remember him pulling out the massive tome, opening it, and explaining to me that its author, Josh McDowell, once had similar questions to the ones I was asking. McDowell’s questions drove him to research the resurrection of Jesus extensively. This book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict, was the compilation of all of McDowell’s research.

I gave the book a try. In the introduction, McDowell describes his compulsion to prove that Jesus did not rise from the dead. By the time McDowell finished compiling all the data, however, he had become a Christian himself. At the end of the introduction, McDowell emphatically declared that the evidence for Christianity is so great that the only reason a person would disagree with it is because they want to disagree. His confidence in the evidence was so great, he insisted, that anyone who objected was willfully rejecting the truth.

The chapters following the introduction were a collection of such intense research notes that the entire book looked like nothing but boring footnotes. Skimming through it, I realized that it would take me forever to finish the book. Surely, someone with that much evidence must be right! So, I gave up and just accepted what McDowell said. My assumption was that I could accept the basics of the faith, but the endless study on the complex biblical questions would have to wait until I was older.

Compare this deluge of theological information to the dream I had about the playground and Jesus appearing to me. From that dream, I felt an intense connection to the spiritual, a sensation of something real but far beyond my comprehension, and I learned of a God who was willing to bend complex ideas into a framework that my mind could understand. I felt love, I felt the weight of sin, and I felt the need for Jesus to save me. Everything was so simple in the dream! But now, I also had been exposed to this milieu of complex theological ideas. How was I supposed to discern what was true?

Everything regarding these lovely spiritual experiences changed for me when I was eleven and twelve. It has taken me until nearly the age of forty to piece together what happened.

# Chapter 5 - Church Conflict

The passing of my dad’s father in May of 1996—coupled with some brewing controversies at the Evangelical Free Church in Wichita—pressed my parents into some reflection about their faith. They, along with several other families in their Sunday school class, were taking their faith very seriously, especially as it regarded finances. My parents had made a concerted effort to get out of all debt, motivated by the belief that being in debt was displeasing to God. The idea was that a Christian should not be monetarily beholden to someone else because it could hinder their ability to listen to God’s call on their life.

For some time, I had been overhearing conversations about issues with the leadership at the Evangelical Free church we had been attending. I remember the Sunday we were returning home from church in the blue Pontiac Voyager minivan we had nicknamed Old Guts, and my parents announced to us kids that we would be leaving that church because they were not properly following the Lord. In response to my asking why, my parents explained that church members had recently voted on whether to borrow money for a new sanctuary. A majority of members voted to borrow a large sum, but my parents thought it would have been best to let the Lord provide before they started the sanctuary.

The prior year, roughly 1996, I had been making some good friends at the Evangelical Free church. I can distinctly remember a fun outing for our Sunday school class, around the time I met my friend Aaron. It was a beautiful summer Kansas day, and we played outdoor games and ate some wonderful food. That was one of the best and happiest days of my childhood. It felt like all was so perfect. So, I was shocked and saddened to hear that this church was so wrong that we needed to leave.

Our family began a tour of Wichita churches. I remember visiting two in particular. 

One of those was a primarily Black church. I am super thankful to my parents for taking us there. They were careful to tell us kids that, even though some people look different than us, God does not see them any differently than he sees us. That moment was important to me as it impressed upon me that no group of humans is morally superior over others because of genetic characteristics.

We also visited a Pentecostal church, which had a bigger impact. I can remember standing on the left side of the sanctuary next to my parents and siblings, watching attendees raise their hands during the singing. I vaguely remember some people murmuring in tongues, and there was a discussion about how the believers were trusting God to heal a woman with cancer. Afterwards, my dad recalled that one of the preachers said the woman had previously been healed but that the cancer had come back. He found that deceptive, and I believe that was one of several reasons we did not go back to that church. I agreed that it seemed premature to announce a healing and then observe its return. If God had performed the healing, He did not do a very permanent job of it.

Simultaneous to this church search, my parents kept in touch with several other families from the Evangelical Free church, who were also leaving. Discussions had begun about potentially starting their own church. This was exciting! After several months of informal conversations, between eight and ten families were committed to starting a church.

The formal meetings to begin this new church began in early 1997. Many of these meetings were held in family houses and sometimes in a side room of another church. Many discussions were had about the foundations of this church’s mission and doctrine. At one point, they announced that my dad was going to be one of the elders, which made me quite proud, even though I had no clue what being an elder meant. 

We kids were allowed to observe many of these discussions, which I found quite eye-opening. It was fascinating watching adults discuss their faith and theological issues. I distinctly remember a lot of deliberation around the accuracy of various Bible translations and an expressed desire to focus only on what the Bible said. It was insisted that the best translation would strive to remain faithful to the original Greek and Hebrew. I was intrigued by how even a tiny change in wording could drastically alter the meaning of a passage. And I was hopeful that perhaps some of the Bible questions I had accumulated could be answered with a better understanding of the original texts. Ultimately, the English Standard Version (ESV) was praised as the best translation. The first official full service of this new house church took place on Mother’s Day, May 11, 1997.

At some point, the elders extended an offer to anyone who wanted to be baptized, and four of us kids around the age of twelve agreed. As a part of this agreement, we were to tell our testimony, an account of how we knew that we were Christians.

Leading up to baptism, I had growing anxiety around how people could know whether they were going to heaven or hell. I had heard multiple Christian evangelists declare that if you did not know the exact moment you were saved, then you were probably not a real Christian. The salvation of your soul, they insisted, is such a transformative experience that you could not possibly miss it. But I did not know the exact date or time when I was saved. I, for sure, knew I was a sinner; after all, we have all made choices to do something our conscience screamed at us not to do. I also knew and believed wholeheartedly that Jesus had died for my sins and rose from the dead. I even had a dream in which this was shown to me! But I could not pinpoint a particular moment when I had “accepted Jesus” in an outburst of weeping and contrition. So, a nagging voice was beginning to nudge me into wondering if I were truly a real Christian, and each time it did, a mini panic attack would drive me to anxiety.

On the day of the baptism service, our new community met in one of the picnic shelters at Harvey County East Lake. Each of us kids who had agreed to be baptized were to share our testimony, and I was incredibly nervous. I did not know quite what to say. So, when it was my turn, I looked around at the gathered group of my friends and my parents’ friends and just tried being honest. I told them that I did not remember a particular moment of salvation but that I believed in the gospel (the good news) of Jesus and wanted to follow Him. I might have shared the story of my dream. Despite my reservations, I remember the pastor’s wife telling me afterwards that what I said deeply touched her, but I had no idea why.

The four of us were then baptized in the muddy waters of Harvey County East Lake. Afterwards, we spent much of the afternoon hunting for clams with our feet in the sandy lakeshore. All the while, I was basking in a new glow, feeling assured that I had done something right and good and profoundly important in my life and that God was smiling down on me. I felt deeply that God approved of what I had done.

It was a few months later that my dad’s cousin, Anastasia, was killed on that Halloween of 1997 as recounted in the Preface. My experience at her funeral would be the first truly demonic encounter in my life, and even years later when I was an atheist, it would continue to perplex me. What I did not know was that this demonic encounter had perhaps opened a door that was about to unleash hell on my life.

# Chapter 6 - Redeemer Bible Church

The new church was named Redeemer Bible Church, and despite what I am about to share, I do have a lot of fond memories during that time.

As the next year passed, the Christian teaching our church embraced became, to quote a longtime friend, “very wooden.” There was a heavy emphasis on accuracy of words, on theological training, and on verbally asserting accurate beliefs. The teaching was often from a Calvinist-leaning perspective . I remember an unspoken sentiment that we were somehow a part of one of the most theologically accurate churches in Wichita. And since we believed the devil uses lies to deceive people into sinning, the best defense against him is being the most factually correct – to have correct doctrine .

We all spent a lot of time in Bible study, and it was during this time that I began learning modern skills in Bible interpretation. I use the word modern because, as most students of the Bible will tell you, the tools we use today were unavailable to early Christians. I was being pulled into more frequent and deeper discussions on topics like soteriology (the study of salvation), eschatology (the study of the end times), and theories regarding the origins of life and which passages of the Bible were allegorical or literal.

Studying these things was enjoyable, but I often felt that we were missing out on interactions from the spiritual realm. Where were these angels and demons and miracles and supernatural events that the Bible speaks of?

I rarely heard stories about the paranormal or dreams or visions or anything of that sort. I remember a few discussions about the dangers of the Ouija board, a couple of references to haunted houses, and the occasional story of a minor miracle, but nothing occurring close to home that could not be explained rationally. There were multiple discussions about the dangers of Pentecostal churches and how they were being influenced by demons. The Christians around me steered clear of indulging in seeking out or expressing spiritual interactions.

Instead of emphasizing miracles like healings and prophecy, we were regularly reminded that changed behavior (like overcoming addiction) is the true miracle. Following Jesus meant following his commandments. So, you first believe and are saved, and then the proof of your belief is that you do what Jesus said. Being a good Christian was the miracle.

Despite a reliance on changed behavior as proof that you were saved, there was also the constant reminder not to rely on our works for salvation. We were taught that the Catholics rely on their works for salvation, so their teachings were considered mostly heretical, and they were generally belittled. I remember hearing the occasional concession that some Catholics might be saved, but they were still deceived. Granted, I cannot remember a single time as a kid ever interacting with a Catholic, or going to Mass, or reading a Catholic book.

At our church, the Bible was highly emphasized as the only way God can truly be trusted to speak to us. The text itself was the gold standard for all truth—not your feelings, not voices in your head, and especially not teachers from various cults around the world. The Bible itself was the very living Word of God, breathed out into those letters on the page, and it was completely flawless and without any error. Yet we were being told that some translations have problems. So how can the Bible be without error?

The answer I was repeatedly given was that only the original manuscripts—authored by the prophets or apostles in their native languages—were without blemish. But where were these original manuscripts? If they are so important, why couldn’t we look at them? One answer I was given: God, in His wisdom, had made sure these original texts were not kept around so that we would not be tempted to worship them instead of Him. I am not kidding. This was the only explanation I received as to why the original manuscripts no longer exist. But the Bible did not say this.

With so much at stake (e.g., hell and damnation), it seemed strange to me that some of these theological questions did not seem to bother others as much as they bothered me. If our correct doctrine and salvation depended on a proper understanding of our supposed beliefs, yet some of the translations we based those beliefs on were problematic, how could we know whether our understanding was trustworthy? And yet, we would casually talk about how lost everyone else in the world was, implying that we, of course, were certainly not lost.

While we were learning all these so-called doctrinal truths, we were consistently being reminded that some people think they are going to heaven but will end up in hell. Those people are absolutely convinced of their relationship with God but are completely deceived by the devil. Well, how could I know I was not one of these people?

This thought began to torment me over and over—every day. How could I know I was saved and had the “right beliefs”? The apostle Paul wrote that the Spirit of God is given to us a guarantor of our salvation and that the Spirit confirms with our spirit that we are children of God. But I did not feel this at all! And when I would bring this concern up, I would be told that I should not trust my feelings. But what else could the apostle Paul possibly be referring to other than trusting some sort of internal sensation or voice?

Nothing worked to suppress my anxiety. How could I tell from my behavior whether I had done enough—or believed correctly enough—to escape hell? How could I know for sure?

Every time I read the Bible, every time a preacher gave an altar call, every time someone shared their testimony of how they got saved, and nearly every time we took communion at church, I could feel the panic welling up within me. Maybe I was a fake!

The church meetings were becoming—how should I say—intense. That first summer, the church focused heavily on three topics that, looking back, deeply affected me: abortion, Christian martyrdom, and the theory of evolution.

I remember the abortion topic taking center stage for a while via the influence of a family friend from Wichita, who had founded a ministry that put up billboards with images of aborted fetuses around college campuses to spur conversations about the horrors of abortion. This group would debate students on the morality of abortion and record the encounters. This was before YouTube and other streaming platforms, so they would turn their interviews into VHS tapes that could be purchased or received from a donation to their group.

One Sunday, it was announced that all kids aged twelve and older would be allowed to sit in the church ceremony, instead of going to their kid's ministry classes. In 1997, I was twelve so I was allowed to join. We all watched one of this ministry’s videos, which detailed the horrors of abortions, replete with images that are still seared into my mind—body parts of an aborted fetus laid out on a table one by one by the abortion doctors to ensure no parts were left in the mother. One fetus was displayed beside a quarter to show its size. I still vividly remember this moment twenty-seven years later. At the time, I didn't even know what sex was!

Discussion of the martyrdom topic was prompted by our church’s new support for Voice of the Martyrs, a ministry that helps Christians around the globe suffering severe persecution. At one point, we even traveled from Wichita to the Voice of the Martyrs ministry headquarters in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. I remember parts of the tour quite vividly. While we walked around the printing presses, the adults talked about the printing of books and some of the ministries. I also remember meeting the now deceased and disgraced Tom White, who was the executive director of Voice of the Martyrs. White was famous for his stories of alleged imprisonment and torture in Cuba because of his Christian faith. He later committed suicide after being accused of sexually assaulting a young girl.

That trip to Voice of the Martyrs led me to read the book Tortured for Christ by Richard Wurmbrand, which details some of the horrid tortures, lies, and travesties carried out by the Soviet Russian regime in Romania in the 1940s and ‘50s. Wurmbrand, who had himself been imprisoned and tortured, describes how the prison guards used every ounce of their violent imaginations to coerce Christians to give up their faith or at least betray other members of their congregation. I remember reading stories of parents being forced to watch the mutilation of their kids and of people being locked in rooms where starving rats ate them alive. The underlying message of the entire book was the haunting reminder that good Christians never deny their faith, even when being tortured.

This book shook me to my thirteen-year-old core. I started having nightmares and panic attacks. On top of the fear that I might be deceiving myself about being a true Christian because I could not remember that “one moment” when I had received salvation, I was now faced with a whole new set of anxieties. How could I know whether I would be able to endure if I were tortured for my faith? What if I were to give in and Jesus abandoned me? Fear was suffocating me like the gently tightening grip of a boa constrictor.

I tried opening to my parents about these panic attacks and doubts, but they would simply reassure me that I was experiencing the hormonal changes of puberty and that all my friends were “going through the same thing.” But my friends were not having continual nightmares or horrible panics during church services. What was wrong with me, and how could this possibly be caused by puberty?

Going to church began to frighten me. Deep within my bones, I felt that this new church environment was at least partly to blame for my problems, and I decided I should talk to someone at church about it.

Around this time, I remember awaking to a gorgeous day, the sun streaming gently into my room in our house on Perry Street. For the first time in a while, things seemed somewhat normal, and I felt some relief from this increasing grip of fear and panic that was enveloping my life. As I thought about attending church, I could feel a panic attack developing so I knew I needed to say something, and I suggested not going to church at all.

Unfortunately, my attempt at reaching out for help was seen as willful resistance. Instead of receiving compassion from this person, I was met with extreme physical abuse. It was full of extreme anger and controlling behavior—a pure rage—that to this day the person claims not to remember. They beat me until I was in the fetal position. I was terrified to my core. 

It was not until this past year that I was finally able to process this incident and see how much damage it caused me all those years ago. The emotional anguish I was feeling from those intense topics, coupled with the physical abuse I had suffered from someone I trusted, led me to a sort of mental split. After the incident, my subconscious understood that I must do and believe what this church—what this person—said I should do and believe. The treatment I received was simply what I deserved for doing something so bad as not wanting to go to church. The guilt, anxiety, and depression increased even more.

So, I suppressed it all—I suppressed the feelings, I suppressed the incident. And at the encouragement of my parents, I began just to accept that there was something wrong with me. This is what they were telling others. In fact, on the same Sunday I was attacked, my mother had asked the entire church to pray for me because they “did not know what was wrong with me.”

It was around this same time that a dark and evil spiritual presence showed up in my life. It started small, in the form of waking nightmares and fits of anxiety that kept me from sleeping. I would be tossing and turning in bed while foreboding thoughts and images entered my mind—sinister creatures or faces that felt more real than typical mental images. On one occasion, I distinctly remember seeing in my half-asleep mind a demonic being hovering in front of me. While my siblings slept nearby, these tormentors would wisp into my consciousness like unwelcome visitors and linger there, staring me down with the purest of hatred.

One night was particularly bad. Upon closing my eyes, my mind was flooded with doubts about my salvation, the torments of hell, and the thought of being tortured to death for my faith. Maybe I would deny Christ later in life and go to hell anyway! The good feelings of God’s presence in my life that I once had were now a distant memory and no amount of endless prayer was helping. I felt that God had completely and utterly abandoned me to be tormented by demons. I would repeatedly call my parents into my room to tell them something was truly wrong, and I needed help. But, again and again, my endless cries were met by their reassurance that I just needed sleep. They simply did not know what to do and saw me as the problem.

Night after night, I would lie completely awake in bed, sensing that a being full of the purest hatred had entered my room and was just staring at me. I could not see it. In fact, I never saw it in real life. I could just feel that it was there, hating me. It wanted me, it wanted to destroy me. All the hair on my body would stand up on end, and I did not dare open my eyes for fear that it would materialize in front of me. I was scared to death. What was this? What was going on? Nobody else at church talked about having experiences like this! I had heard many things about Satan, but was this him? Maybe this was just more proof that “something was wrong with me.”

Many, many times I tried talking to other Christian adults about the doubts and thoughts I was having. On multiple occasions, I was told that I was just being arrogant and focusing way too much on myself. My mom would often tell me that my feelings were meaningless and that I should ignore them, suppress them, and just do what I was supposed to do. Simultaneously, my dad was telling me that I appeared to be a Christian, so it must be the devil trying to get me to doubt my salvation, and I should just believe. 

These contradictory messages simply made things worse! Was I arrogant and needing to repent, or was I a good Christian being attacked by the devil?

One day, I was reading my Bible in bed, as was usual for me to do, and I reached the part in Matthew where Jesus says that blaspheming the Holy Spirit is the unforgivable sin. At that moment, a voice that sounded like my own spoke clear as day in my head: The Holy Spirit is a bitch. This terrified me so badly that I could barely continue reading. Had I just blasphemed the Holy Spirit? Was this sinful thought unforgivable? Was I now destined to an eternity in hell? A panic attack began.

One day for the hundredth time I was having a panic attack caused by the suspicion that I might not be a true Christian. It occurred to me that I needed some external evidence, so I told God that I was going to flip a coin five times. If it landed on heads all five times in a row, then I would know I was a true Christian. It came up heads all five times. Relief hit me, but only briefly. The mental torment began again shortly after. It was unrelenting!

This cycle of doubt leading to panic attacks to the feeling that a demonic being had entered my room and then the occasional moment of elated relief continued for years. Usually, I would try to avoid triggers that might set off a panic attack. Communion at church would often set them off because, each time, the minister would remind us that before taking communion we should confess any hidden sins, and if we knew of any sins we had committed against others, we should go to them and confess. After all, some people in the Corinthian church had died because they took communion in an unworthy manner. I would be stricken with guilt and inner turmoil.

Certain Bible passages would also trigger panic attacks, particularly ones that indicated an impossibility of being saved. The writer of Hebrews, for example, warns that a person cannot return to repentance once they “have fallen away” (6:6 NIV). This warning seemed to conflict with the story of Peter, who denied Christ three times yet obviously came back to faith. Nevertheless, I was torn with fear that I might someday be placed into a situation where I would deny the faith. Would I then never be able to return?

Every time I went to adults for some kind of encouragement or understanding, they always indicated confusion at my concerns, and they often expressed annoyance that I was even dealing with these issues! I cannot remember a single person suggesting I might be dealing with something demonic. In all those years, the concept of deliverance was never once mentioned. No one ever even brought up the psychological concepts of anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive thoughts. Instead, the people I spoke to would show me some Bible verses, maybe say a prayer for me, and then try to perk me up by telling me that they thought I was a Christian.

So, I eventually learned to just keep my mouth shut, suffer internally, and pretend like everything was okay. In large part, I was heavily disassociating from my core feelings and building up a persona that fit my environment. I was becoming a shell of a person, acting out the “Christian” role that was expected of me.

Naturally, nonemotional topics were a haven for me because they focused my mind on other problems. When not tormented by anxiety, I played video games, like most other kids. I taught myself computer programming, and I was pretty good at math and science topics. But the core issues I struggled with were always there right under the surface, and I dreaded any triggers that might resurface them.

It is difficult to fully suppress one feeling without suppressing all of them, so naturally, every sensation within me eventually got suppressed. All that remained was a toxic soup of depression and anxiety, coupled with the guilt that I was not a joyful Christian. Being joyful and at peace is a command of God, so was I also sinning by not feeling these things? I often suspected that the only way to know for sure whether I was saved would be to kill myself. One day, in a rattled mental state, I even walked to a bridge on Amidon Street with the thought of jumping. The fear of going to hell stopped me.

# Chapter 7 – Disillusioned with Faith

Around the age of fifteen, this darkness reached a crescendo. I had spent years experiencing panic attacks, feeling demonic presences, and battling suicidal thoughts. But on the outside, I was doing my absolute best to appear normal by holding back the panic attacks and attempting to live out the ideal role the church was saying I needed to fulfill.

Around this time, I had a dream that nearly twenty years later would prove to be one of the most important dreams of my life.

Imagine a pitch-black void, no light to be seen. I was floating by myself in this void, so far from any living being that nothing or no one knew I was there. I could see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, and had no sensation of any other life in existence. I was not in pain or anything, just feeling desperate, alone, and scared.

Without any warning, out of the black fog—about a stone’s throw in front of me—a massive wolf's head lunged toward me. It must have been two to three feet tall, and its face was consumed with rage. I distinctly remember its matted gray fur, its devilish dark eyes, its huge teeth. The dark fog was so thick I could not see its legs.

Within a second, before I had time to yell or scream, the wolf head had reached my face, its hideous teeth mere inches from my nose. Fear froze me, and I knew I was dead. I heard an audible clink. Looking down, I observed a massive metal chain stretched to its limit by the wolf’s neck. The other end of the chain receded into the black fog.

I woke up with a start. Immediately, a calm voice inside my soul whispered the following:

Josh, it does not matter how far the devil goes; he is always on a chain.

As I burst completely awake, I felt overwhelmed by a flood of emotions. The first was a sense of relief that I had received a message that sure seemed to be from God. Then came the realization that my dream of floating alone in a black darkness was how I felt every day. The third emotion was the comfort that God was aware of my internal turmoil and that it was indeed something demonic. Lastly, I was reassured that there was somehow a limit to those demonic powers. 

But what did this all mean? Why the cryptic message? Why in the world was the devil attacking me in the first place? Why me?

After the dream, I began to believe that God was preparing me for something and that the devil was allowed to attack me as preparation of some sort. But was I just being arrogant to believe that God might have some incredible plan for what was happening? I was reminded of the story of Joseph—how, when he told his family of his dreams, he was accused of being arrogant and told to shut up. So, I told nobody about this dream for fear of ridicule.

For quite some time, the dream served as the only ray of hope in my spiritual struggles. Deep inside, I knew that even though all my friends and the adults around me did not seem to comprehend what was going on with me, God apparently understood and had a plan. I begged Him on many occasions to make sense of this for me. What possible good could come of this period of my life?

Thankfully, the second half of my teens improved measurably. In addition to the relief that the dream provided me, I had developed some coping mechanisms for dealing with the panic attacks. Most of these coping mechanisms involved thought-stopping devices. Once I identified the triggers for my attacks, I knew to some extent how to brace myself emotionally for those moments.

All my doubts about biblical passages had pushed me to study the Bible and theological issues in greater depth. As my knowledge of theological topics increased, I began to put some intellectual meat on the bones of my spiritual understanding. I studied all theological topics voraciously, often reading and comparing dozens of Bible passages. Often, I was hoping to find a sort of silver bullet that could destroy the doubts that were tormenting me.

Unable to rely on my own internal emotional–spiritual barometer, which I had managed to suppress nearly every ounce of, I naturally began to lean on the intellect. I gravitated toward any hard science that involved certainty, largely because of the comfort it provided. The firm bedrock of intellectual certainty can supply tremendous confidence when you are floundering on a marshland of emotional–spiritual mush. After all, you may not be able to solve a theological problem with certainty, but you sure can solve that math problem and come out feeling assured! So, I gradually began to dive harder into mathematics and the sciences.

# Chapter 8 – Science!

Starting around the age of ten, I became hooked on computer programming. Like most kids growing up in the 1990s, I was fascinated with the rise of video games, but I wanted to not just play them but to build them. So, I spent hours and hours trying to learn QuickBASIC, followed by C and C++. By age fifteen, I taught myself 3D programming by scrounging tutorials from the internet.

I found computer programming to be like painting with math: it provided a blank template from which unlimited creativity could spawn. Starting with an empty screen, you can make the computer do just about anything you want. I built many small video games and got a massive rush out of creating programs to show my siblings or the neighborhood kids. In many cases, my siblings even helped. I remember having so much fun with my brother Ben building a little WWII arcade-style fighter game we called Skyduel.

Computers are comforting to anyone struggling with an environment of emotional instability. Everything the computer does is logical, and even when they appear to do something odd, you can always find a certain explanation for why they do what they do if you just dig enough. Computers can be entirely controlled. I believe this may be part of the reason I dove so heavily into them during this time of spiritual and emotional chaos internally.

Similarly, science offers a set of tools that are controlled and aim to produce results that are predictable. I was equally drawn to scientific topics.  I was fascinated with evolution and origins of life, primarily from a young-earth standpoint. I even tracked down a copy of On the Origin of Species. At the time, I could not understand how anyone in their right mind would believe something so utterly stupid. As a budding computer programmer, I knew how hard it was to program even the simplest computer program. So how in the world could someone be so dumb as to believe that human DNA—the software of our cell—evolved without an engineer?

Until that point, I had been led to believe that evolution was a nonsensical notion that all life had started as messy machines that magically shifted themselves into higher life forms over millions of generations - accidentally. I grew up in a house full of Answers in Genesis magazines and books, and I had even met and hung out with Ken Ham for some time with my dad at a conference. 

But one fateful day I distinctly remember when the theory of evolution clicked, and for a moment, the beauty of its simplicity dazzled me. Evolution was not the idea that things magically become better over time, but a theory about how small changes in the genome can shift a creature to be more suited to a particular environment. An evolved creature does not become better overall, it just now survives better in a particular environment. Each change might make the creature worse in one environment and make it better in another. A genius engineer is not one that designs a machine to work best in one situation only, but a machine that can adapt to every situation. Evolution was a description of an engineering marvel that can adapt to any situation.

I had been building a lot of video games, and I discovered that one of the most tedious parts of building a video game is building the characters within the game. First, you must figure out how the characters are going to behave. Then, you must program their responses to different stimuli in their environment, and at some point, you must work on their size and appearance. All this designing gets quite repetitive.

Eventually, I realized that you could design the computer program to auto-generate a variety of different environments and characters in the game. Maybe some code could be written to adapt all the characters to fit into their specific environment. This approach is called procedural generation, where you design an algorithm that uses random processes to generate an environment or objects.

With a startled mix of surprise and horror, I understood evolution was not just a simple theory, but if it was true then evolving life was absolutely genius. Evolution was like a procedural program adapting all known life outward into every environment. If the universe itself contained the right foundational variables and ingredients, life could, in theory, be adapted to exist within any environment the universe produced (within reason). In fact, this phenomenon would allow for such a great diversity of life that the number of possible worlds and species were essentially infinite. God was a genius!

I was astounded! But I was also horrified. How dare I question God’s Word! Evolution is a lie! I wrestled with these “rebellious” thoughts. I distinctly remember thinking that maybe the only reason I found evolution beautiful was because the devil made it look beautiful.

I must suppress these thoughts! My mind was entering dangerous territory, and I was starting to deny aspects of the literal Bible story. God had clearly created the earth in six days, not in millions of years. Humans were not descended from some other primate. I tried and tried to put the toothpaste back in the tube, but once your mind grasps a concept it is hard to reverse course.

Impulsively, I began to consume more literature on the topics of biology and evolution. It might be worth mentioning that I did not in my teens tend to stray too far outside the fundamentalist Protestant sources provided by our church community. Other than On the Origin of Species (which was a massively dated work), I don’t remember reading any books by contemporary evolutionists or biologists. All efforts were made to ensure conformity in thought. If we were to study any controversial topic, we would usually read not the source material itself but a book about the source material written by one of the generally approved Christian authors. The more I read, the more uneasy I got at the ham-fisted way the Christian authors would often describe opposing viewpoints. Could they not at least admit that there were some good points in evolutionary theory? Were all Christians this stubborn?

My good grades enabled me to get a scholarship to Butler Community College in El Dorado, Kansas. As was typical for homeschoolers in Wichita, I began college early, at the age of seventeen. I had not technically graduated from high school, but my parents decided that the college classes could count toward both my high school graduation and my college credits. 

Several years had passed since the worst of the dark times, when my panic attacks and doubts consistently overwhelmed me, and I had managed to find a semblance of mental and emotional stability. The ability to make new friends and drive around the greater Wichita area was freeing.

The classes at Butler and my new job in their IT department provided my first regular exposure to secular culture. Compared to most other states, Kansas is traditionally more religious and, especially, more Christian, so I did have a nice collection of Christian friends during that time as well. But making friends who were not Christian really began to challenge me.

One of my non-Christian friends was Ryan, whom I met in Calculus I. We had a lot of fun shooting guns at the range, driving around town, studying together, and talking about religion. I remember feeling compelled to share the gospel with him, and my heart went out to him so much. He seemed quite lonely, and his mom and stepfather appeared to have a toxic lifestyle. Most of the kids I knew growing up did not come from broken homes, and it saddened me to see how affected Ryan was by those aspects of his childhood.

My desire to reach the lost and make a difference pushed me to start several college Bible studies. My friend Aaron and I started the first group at our local church. I drafted a document explaining the purpose of the group, along with our stated goals to study the Bible, sing, pray, and get other college kids from around town to attend. It was to be a completely open Bible study. Word quickly spread, and we regularly had over twenty people show up from all over town.

This group was based in Wichita, where I still lived with my parents, but I was inspired to branch out because I was getting compliments on my Bible teaching. Simultaneously, I was working part time for my aunt and uncle an hour away in Hutchinson and had made a lot of friends there. Also, I was going to school and working in El Dorado, which was forty-five minutes in the opposite direction. I figured why not start Bible studies in these other towns as well. So, I had three separate Bible studies going at once, and I would regularly travel back and forth in my Honda Accord. Looking back, my schedule was packed.

All in all, this was a joyful time for me, full of many amazing friends, new experiences, and personal growth! But all the traveling around began opening my eyes, which allowed me to see that something truly dark was creeping into my family's church. Beth-Eden Baptist Church was about to hire a narcissist pastor.

For reasons I did not know, our Pastor Phil had been pushed out. As is often the case when there is a potential underlying scandal, most of us were given a generic explanation for his dismissal. And the elders, one of whom was my father, felt an urgent need to hire a new lead pastor for the congregation of roughly one hundred parishioners.

One of the elders at Beth-Eden was enamored with an extremely popular preacher named John MacArthur, who pastored a church out in California. MacArthur was known for his unwavering devotion to a set of teachings called Reformed theology, which aligned closely with the Reformation movement of the sixteenth century. He was renowned and praised for a large collection of theological books he had authored, in particular The MacArthur Study Bible. Due to this rising shift in popular Protestant culture, most of the elders at Beth-Eden became quite interested in hiring a pastor from The Master’s Seminary, which was partially founded by John MacArthur.

After a short search, the elders found a candidate who had recently left a split church. I will refer to him throughout this book as Pastor Joe. Steve Friesen explained to me many years later that the elders hired Pastor Joe rather quickly, not performing much of a background check. As a result, they did not know—and Joe certainly did not divulge—that he had worked maliciously to split his previous church and that he had a sordid history of being an extreme bully. The elders just knew that he was “biblical” and that he practiced the style of teaching espoused by John MacArthur.

I distinctly remember one of Joe’s first sermons: a monologue on the meaning and importance of repentance. His schtick was to take a couple Bible verses, knead them into an overcooked loaf of analogies, humorous quips, and scholarly references, and then shovel them at you with a smile and an implied heavenly threat. In this sermon, Pastor Joe warned us that repentance means change—true change from the heart—and that if people’s behavior does not change, then they have not truly repented and will suffer the fate of all sinners. He ended the sermon with an abrupt hand-waving, almost dismissive, invitation to repentance for anyone in the audience who might not know Jesus. Nobody went forward.

Something about the sermon rubbed me wrong. On the surface, I agreed with nearly everything Pastor Joe said, but his words boasted a black-and-white confidence that seemed unearned. How could this man, who was only a few years older than I was, be somehow put into a position of authority over everyone in the church, without any meaningful vetting, simply because he attended a particular theological school and presented well on stage?

Shortly after Pastor Joe was hired, I and my friend Aaron, with whom I had been running the college group, were invited to join our church’s elders at a conference in California, where we would visit John MacArthur’s church and seminary. At the time, I was graduating from community college and was considering ministry of some sort. Since this seminary was popular among everyone I knew, it seemed worth checking out.

We drove the entire distance from Wichita, Kansas, to the San Fernando Valley, which afforded us lots of car-time for conversation. Pastor Joe was flamboyant, charismatic, jocular, and gregarious. And since his demeanor and statements were filled with such unwavering confidence, I decided to poke his brain about some unresolved theological topics that I had been honing my knowledge about. I wanted to see if Pastor Joe possessed enough humility to admit that some topics were not so black and white.

Prior to Pastor Joe’s arrival, I had been exploring the topic of free will versus predestination. Are humans preselected by God for heaven or hell or are we free to choose? I had been studying numerous Bible verses on the topic and was well-versed enough (pun unintended) to know that even in the Greek and Hebrew wording some passages leaned toward free will and others suggested predestination. As a result, devout scholars and people across all aisles of Christendom disagreed on this topic. So, while Pastor Joe drove, I peppered him with questions from the shotgun seat.

I do not remember all that was said during our conversation on predestination, but I do recall Pastor Joe’s use of a phrase that irked me deeply. He confidently declared “we believe” before rattling off some typical predestination jargon. It bothered me greatly that this young man, barely a few years older than myself, had the gall to tell me what I believed. So, of course, I pushed back, but the more I pushed, the more he insisted his perspective was right and that I must agree with him. Realizing I was getting nowhere, I decided to keep my mouth shut. But I made a mental note that Pastor Joe seemed indifferent to anyone else’s thoughts and was interested only in guiding us like sheep.

At the conference, my friend Aaron and I purchased matching miniature Bibles from the bookstore. Shortly after, we spotted John MacArthur and decided to go up and meet him. He was surrounded by a cadre of bodyguards, replete with suits and earpieces. We had been told that, because of his unwavering preaching of the Bible, MacArthur had been receiving death threats. It felt like we were meeting a celebrity. When we asked John MacArthur to sign our Bibles, he gladly agreed. I cringe when I think about it now. What humble person signs a Bible?

We took a short tour of the seminary, and since I was considering attending, I asked various questions of the people we met. Whether from the answers I received or just from the general vibe of the campus, I remember the distinct feeling in my soul that something was off about this entire situation. I mostly ignored it at the time, but I did not end up going to John MacArthur’s seminary.

This one small trip and especially that awkward conversation with Pastor Joe was to be the tip of an iceberg that slowly revealed itself over the next couple of years, as his true face was unmasked.

# Chapter 9 - Church Power Struggle

Aaron and I continued our leadership of the college group, and with my gut screaming something was off about Pastor Joe, that group soon became the only thing at church that truly gave me joy. Teaching the Bible a couple times a week forced me to dive into every topic imaginable, filling my Bible with notes and cross-references and my mind with biblical knowledge. For a couple years, we had been given permission to meet in one of the houses owned by the church, and our group proceeded without incident or oversight.

“We have decided that going forward there should be an elder of the church present at every meeting and that anything taught should be run by us beforehand.”

“Who is we?” I asked, somewhat startled. The sense of entrapment was growing rapidly within me.

“Yes, the elders and I. We have decided that these changes will need to take place.”

“Have we done something wrong?”

“Oh no! You all are doing good, and we love that your group has grown so much. We just feel that since you have a lot of people attending who are not from our church, we need to make sure what is being taught is theologically accurate.”

I got the impression that he was not telling me everything. Why, if we were doing so well, were restrictions being added? The thought of an elder awkwardly monitoring us from the corner of the room flashed before my eyes—his raison d’être to chaperone a group that had never had a single scandal. It felt creepily controlling. It also felt quite odd that Pastor Joe had invited me into his office to declare these new rules to me alone.

I tried pushing back against Pastor Joe, explaining my concern that we might start to lose group members if we were chaperoned by an elder every meeting. Like when I pushed back on his theological cockiness during that trip to the conference, Pastor Joe responded forcefully against every question I raised. It was clear to me that I had no say. I left that meeting bewildered.

Several other incidents around this time made me even more uneasy about Pastor Joe. One Sunday, in the foyer after church service, I listened as he recounted a story from that week about a homeless person who had come into his office, seeking physical help. Pastor Joe proudly told us that he had shared the gospel with this homeless person. The man resisted, saying he just needed some food or money. Pastor Joe sent the homeless man away empty-handed, declaring that there was no point in helping him physically if he was not willing to accept the gospel.

This scared me. How could anyone be that callous? Are there not countless passages where Jesus helps people who are ungrateful or who disagree on theological topics? Pastor Joe seemed almost gleeful that he could flippantly throw a person out on the street for disagreeing with his theology.

Another time, I was in the sanctuary while Pastor Joe was chatting with some adults. I cannot remember what minor offense his young daughter committed, but Pastor Joe scolded her so harshly for it, that it drove her nearly to tears. Rather than spotting her pain, he quickly and virulently chided her to keep quiet and not cry. Pastor Joe nonchalantly returned to chatting and joking with the adults about some unserious matter.

Internally, my fear of his callous behavior was intensifying. I felt something must be done about it. Pastor Joe had been preaching through a series on the book of Matthew, and one sermon covered the passage where Jesus advises how to resolve conflicts among members in the church body. According to Jesus, the wrongdoer should first be confronted by a single person, then by a small group, and finally by the whole church. If the person does not listen and repent at any of those stages, they should be cast out of the assembly and treated as an outsider. Following Pastor Joe’s own teaching on this passage, I decided to confront him alone about his callousness toward others.

We met at a local Starbucks. Over the years, I had met with various friends there more than a dozen times. It was a familiar place to me, a safe place.

After ordering our drinks, the two of us sat at one of the booths. We both had our Bibles in front of us, a clear indication to everyone else in the room of our devotion to our faith. With as much tact as I could muster, I briefly told Pastor Joe the reason I had wanted to meet with him.

The way Joe transformed from charismatic to furious still disturbs me. Thrown into a rage, he proceeded to threaten me – barely 20 years old - with discipline by the elders or even expulsion from the church. He completely ignored everything I had said, and it was obvious he only felt that his power was being challenged. Sensing this was a lost cause—and realizing he was disrupting the entire Starbucks with his raised voice—I decided my only choice was to walk out. I did not look back while he literally yelled at me from his seat.

Climbing into my small white Honda Accord, I visibly shook as I turned back onto Amidon Street to head home. The contrast between the beautiful weather and my broken heart was palpable. My entire social world was potentially crumbling before my eyes. Everything I knew at that time revolved around this church, my church friends, my family who attended that church, and the large network of friends I was meeting at the college group. I was now thrust into a power struggle that I did not understand. 

I drove home in a daze, trying to pull myself together and contemplating what I could possibly do. The situation was so unusual, like nothing I had ever faced. Concerningly, I realized I had no witnesses for the two private conversations I had with Pastor Joe. He was seen by so many in our church as a charismatic saint. But now to me, his behavior did not at all seem Christlike. If his actions were not from God, then what was I dealing with? And who could I possibly talk to about what had happened? I immediately thought of my dad. He would know what to do.

Audibly disturbed on the phone, I recounted to my dad what had happened. I told him about the controlling, callous, and unloving behavior I had observed in Pastor Joe, and about how I felt I had done the right thing in confronting him in private about it. I explained how I was simply following Jesus’ own instruction in the gospel of Matthew. I told him about Joe’s response, how he threatened me and yelled at me. I remember the silence as I waited for my dad to give some sort of response. When he finally did, my heart sank even further when he just played devil’s advocate. By the time the call ended, he had entirely taken Pastor Joe’s side, completely ignoring Joe’s rage. My dad offered no support and continued to take Joe’s side in almost every conflict for years until the dam finally broke. 

What was going on? Was there nobody I could turn to, nobody who would believe me? And what kind of person was I dealing with, who could seduce everyone I knew into thinking he was such a godly man? With my only possible advocate refusing to believe my side of the story, I felt forced to submit to whatever this volatile and power-hungry man wanted.

# Chapter 10 – Dog from the Dead

Around this same time, roughly 2004, I took my first start-up job for a small company founded by a couple friends from El Dorado, Kansas. Their north star was to get into the cloud storage space.

My girlfriend at the time and several of my friends in El Dorado were attending a church that could be considered a brand of Pentecostal . At first, I was open to it, but then some of the behaviors I observed and some of their more extreme spiritual claims caused me to squirm.

Their church hosted prophecy classes, where people would get together and practice prophesying about each other. From what I gathered, they ran under the assumption that any Christian could prophecy; you just had to tap into and listen carefully to an internal voice they assumed was the Holy Spirit. The purpose of the class was to practice listening to this internal voice and proclaiming things over people. It was emphatically declared that making mistakes in prophesying is a normal part of the process but that with continued practice your prophecies become more consistently accurate. I never attended any of these prophecy classes myself, but I remember having some debates with several people, including my girlfriend, because many of them were trying to convince me to get involved. “Practicing prophecy” scared me. I knew from experience that listening to voices in your head can get ugly.

My skepticism was strongly validated soon after by an experience with one of the younger men at the church whose dog had recently passed away. In his grief, he declared on Facebook that he felt God had told him that his dog would rise from the dead in three days.

I was shocked at the commingling of faith and absurd claims. Here was a young man my age, who was perfectly confident he had heard from God, and the voice ended up being completely wrong. Either he was listening to the devil, he was attempting to manifest his own internal hopes, or he was mentally disturbed. Sadly, I don’t remember any wise Christian adults stepping in to correct. Instead, he just floundered online under a flurry of toxic comments. I still wonder what happened to him, as I am sure he was hit hard by the ensuing embarrassment, not to mention his grief.

Observing this entire experience hit me so hard, because my gut had been right about these “prophecy classes.” As much as I would have been open to this church’s approach to prophecy being true, I began to doubt their entire understanding of faith. I began to doubt prophecy altogether.

Contrast this church with my church back in Wichita, led by Pastor Joe. The Pentecostal church took an almost hippie attitude toward Christian faith, encouraging a spiritual freedom that clearly bordered on the absurd. Pastor Joe was so rigorous and controlling there were direct reports that he was using church members as spies. It was like Woodstock versus Soviet Russia, and as far as I was concerned, both seemed misguided! Where was God in this?

In the Pentecostal church, each person was encouraged to listen internally for the voice of the Holy Spirit. At Beth-Eden, there was an assumption that anybody exhibiting miraculous signs of the Spirit today is most likely exhibiting the devil or playing a trick. We were repeatedly reminded that the truly wise Christian listens ultimately to the exact text of Scripture. How could both churches be following God when their foundational epistemology was so radically different?

For several years, I had become quite good at suppressing doubts and questions about Christianity. But these recent experiences were inescapable, and I felt paralyzed as to how to proceed. My faith in the leadership and authority structure of any church was collapsing. I was beginning to feel that the churches I grew up in were just businesses with religious lingo and the usual corporate power structures. And it felt to me that the churches that were really trying to “manifest God” were so desperate for proof that they were prophesying about dead dogs rising from the dead – and failing.

Where was God’s real presence in any church?

Most of the Christians I knew and grew up around considered the Bible to be the foundation of all truth and of their entire congregational social structure. The constant claim I heard was that we should “check everything against Scripture.” But because of all I had now seen, I was beginning to look behind the claims and not just trust them at face value. Upon further reflection, I noticed that the churches I knew had a strategy about the Bible that seemed to be the exact opposite of what they claimed. The leaders tended to establish a baseline of what they believed and then tell their members—before they even read the Bible—what the Bible says. Then when someone in the congregation (like me) encountered a verse that did not fit that belief system, the leaders would hem and haw and eventually use power to enforce consistency in the social structure. For example, they would say you are allowed to ask questions, but if you then come to a different conclusion, you could have your membership revoked or even be completely expelled from the community. If the truths in the Bible are so obvious and perfect, how was it possible for there to be so many stark divisions? Why are there so many passages that are ambiguous? Why would God be ambiguous? Where was God in all of this?

While I had already visited John MacArthur's seminary in California and was now feeling a bit icky about attending such an institution, there was one more Bible college that I wanted to visit: Moody Bible Institute. The school was a bit legendary in my family. Several of my aunts and uncles had attended and even met their spouses there, and I now had several cousins attending. The Jung name was recognized around campus. While the city of Chicago did not appeal to me, I felt a draw to check out Moody because so many Christians spoke so highly of it.

On my first visit, I remember the bitter cold, the consistent snow, the sunless gloom of a Chicago winter. But also, the coziness of coffee shops and the warmth of friends. We spent most of our time indoors, utilizing the famous underground network of tunnels that connect the Moody buildings. This was during Moody’s Founders Week, a conference generally targeted at Moody students and alumni. I was scanning the environment, contemplating whether maybe someday I should attend the school.

The prospect of attending a Bible school gave me some hope that I might surround myself with scholarly Christians who could answer my deepest questions about the faith because I was losing hope that anyone that I knew could give me good answers. Even as I was entering my twenties, I was not finding the answers I wanted from the people I knew or the books I read, and I felt that my attempts to converse with friends and family members about various biblical topics was being misunderstood. Almost all fellow Christians did not seem to perceive the seriousness of the theological issues I was raising. I was desperate to surround myself with people who were following Christ but who also had studied things in depth and could provide some clarity on many of the issues I was seeing within Scripture and within the church.

After the Founder’s Week visit, I took a few online Moody courses to try things out. These courses introduced me to the key concept of hermeneutics: the methods of interpretation. As we learned, the foremost purpose of interpretation is to discover what the original author intended to communicate to the original readers. Context is king. We must understand the original context of any Bible passage, in its original setting with all its cultural idiosyncrasies, or else we risk misinterpreting the passage.

The process of extracting information from the text is called exegesis, and injecting our own biases into the text is called eisegesis. Stated another way, the goal of hermeneutics is to encourage exegesis and discourage eisegesis. As students of the text, we should want to know only what the original author meant, not what we want it to mean or what fits our agenda!

These tools for interpretation were wonderful for someone like me. I finally had a framework by which I could begin to, on my own, tease apart various passages that had bothered me for quite some time. The Bible felt less enigmatic and more like something that could be mined with these proper tools. And since I had read the English Bible more than ten times at this point, I had so much information memorized that soaking up more of it became easier and easier.

My purpose in all this learning was not to outrun any of my peers but simply to unravel some of the biblical claims that I found disturbing or that filled me with doubts. Ultimately, I was seeking relief for the intellectual and spiritual anxiety that had been plaguing me for years. While I worked to apply the hermeneutical rules I was learning, the internet provided many additional valuable tools to help with interpretation.

At first, these tools were incredible. So many passages opened and became more alive to me as I discovered how various English translations failed to capture the original essence of a passage.

Ironically, as my skills at Bible interpretation and understanding sharpened, these wonderful hermeneutical tools helped me uncover some things that began to disturb me immensely, ultimately fueling my hardcore switch to atheism.

# Chapter 11 – Introduction to Philosophy

Around Christmas of 2006, my friend Aaron called me to announce he was going to attend a small Christian college in Greeley, Colorado, and was curious if I wanted to move out there with him. The small start-up in El Dorado where I had been working was running out of funds and I had just been let go. It was too late for me to apply to any colleges for the spring of 2007, so the timing to move was perfect. I said yes.

At the time, I was renting a small two-bedroom house in El Dorado, Kansas, near the intersection of Race and Carr—two names I always found quite amusing. But despite the fun of the intersection’s name, something incredibly creepy happened at this house that disturbed me so much I have never forgotten it.

When I moved into the rental house, nothing seemed particularly out of place. The landlord appeared nice and cordial, but he was extra cautious about approving someone moving in. He did quite an extensive background check, which I do remember thinking was a little paranoid. But with no criminal record and a good income, I was approved without an issue.

After moving in, a couple things creeped me out immensely. First, there was a large decorative Christian cross—clearly meant to be hung on the wall—in the cabinet beneath the kitchen sink, clearly both ignored but strangely left behind. Second, I discovered that the bedroom I chose for myself had a large and oddly placed crawl space entryway in one of its walls near the head of my bed.

Nearly every night when I was trying to sleep, I felt a sinister sensation emanating from that crawl space. As mentioned in previous chapters, I had already dealt repeatedly with the presence of what I assumed were demonic beings in my life. At this time, I had become accustomed to those sensations, but something in this house felt so different. I could not stop thinking about that crawl space. Something felt so off about it, like there was a dark and evil history clinging to the house.

It bothered me so much that I prayed repeatedly about it. I even took the cross that I had found under the kitchen sink and hung it on the wall in an attempt to lay claim over the space in the spiritual realm as owned by Christ. I do remember opening the crawl space door at one point, but it was too dark to see anything of note within there. There was no poltergeist or voices or anything like that. Just a persistent feeling, especially in my bedroom and toward that crawl space, of a great evil that lingered.

After deciding to move to Colorado, I scheduled a meeting with my landlord to see about terminating my lease early. The landlord was naturally disappointed I was leaving, but he understood. 

Almost as an afterthought, I asked the landlord if there was a history of anything dark happening in the house. He shifted a bit and paused, seemingly a bit disturbed. He proceeded to tell me that the previous tenant had lived there with his young daughter. One day, this tenant was sitting alone on his porch, staring off into space, when police arrived and calmly arrested him. Apparently, he knew his crimes had been discovered and turned himself into the police willingly. 

The landlord did not know the entire story, but he gathered that the tenant had been in some way molesting his daughter in that house—information he obviously wanted to keep hidden from me when I was trying to rent the place. To this day, I have no idea how my gut feeling about this situation was even remotely accurate. None of the places I have lived in since have given me a similar feeling. But this story has stuck with me over the years. Why was it that I was continually able to sense the presence of evil?

Putting all that behind me and in full adventure mode I packed up my few possessions and moved out to Greeley with Aaron. While he began his classes at the tiny Christian college, I began my hunt for a software job, a hunt that began with me reconnecting with an old family friend named Taylor, who had moved from Kansas to Golden, Colorado. Our short time together in Colorado would have a massive influence on my leaving Christianity.

Taylor had made a small “fortune” from being a salesperson for a company that sold electrical engineering software and owned a gorgeous place in the foothills of Golden. As it happened, he and his wife and daughter were going on an extended vacation, and he needed someone to housesit their place. So, I agreed to stay there and take care of things while they were gone.

Taylor was not a Christian. While hanging out, I had intentions of sharing the gospel with Taylor and because he was deep into science and philosophy, I attempted to spar a bit with him on intellectual topics. I had studied a little bit of apologetics (defense of the Christian faith), but not enough in turns out to match Taylor’s study. He appeared to anticipate my every sentence.

He casually told me he that used to be a born-again Christian when he was young. He had gone to church, said the sinner’s prayer, and all that, but he no longer believed. Taylor sympathized with my sheltered and homeschooled upbringing, and he began to open my eyes to the topic of philosophy. He was the first person I had ever met who could “talk the talk” of Christianity but did not believe it!

Taylor suggested that I read an old book that he retrieved from his bookshelf. This small philosophical book was by René Descartes, and if I recall it was his Discourse on the Method. The book was dense and packed full of abstruse concepts. It was intellectual, deep, and stimulating. I was gob smacked by how rigorous Descartes tried to be in his intellectual inquiry.

My relationship with Taylor and this single book opened an intellectual Pandora’s box for me. Up to this point, most of faith through studying apologetics had rested on biblical history and interpretation. Philosophy and psychology were generally seen as dangerous topics within the Christian circles I grew up in. My intention of reading this book was to try and understand Taylor so that I could reach someone like him with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Just as the apostle Paul talks about becoming “all things to all men so that I may win some,” I figured that if God had placed someone like Taylor in my life, it was important for me to genuinely try to understand his perspective.

Over time, however, I was the one who experienced a conversion of sorts, largely because of Taylor’s kindness toward me. He took me to the Coors brewery downtown for a tour, where I got to try my first taste of beer. In addition, he invited me to a wonderful dinner with a red wine. He graciously went into his wine cellar and pulled out a bottle that was worth quite a bit and I had my first glass of wine. It was incredible. I could not understand how someone as articulate, kind, educated, and successful as Taylor could be going to hell. Despite our differences in belief, he seemed to get something about my intellectual approach to life and did not judge me at all for my differences!

As if to garnish a cherry on top of this incredible new life experience, Taylor and his wife introduced me to someone who got me a job at a consulting agency in downtown Denver.

This new job threw even more wood onto the fire of my doubts. My new colleagues were organized, smart, healthy, and quite educated. The idea that rejecting Christ leads to a completely chaotic life was just not playing out. I was forced to interact with kindhearted colleagues who were not Christians, and in many ways their understanding of the world seemed to supersede that of the people I had been raised with. It bothered me immensely that they were all supposedly going to hell. How could these people who were just trying to live normal and healthy lives be going to hell?

One colleague was also a formerly devout Christian. He grew up in a Baptist church where his father was the pastor. But he had abandoned his faith. Just as with Taylor, I remember being intrigued by his apostasy but also confused and a bit scared by it. In all my years of growing up in the church, I had been too sheltered to realize that people could have good intellectual reasons for leaving Christianity! Now I knew two of them, Taylor and Bill! I had always been given the impression that people who leave Christianity do so because they want to sin by abusing alcohol or sleeping around. Instead, both Bill and Taylor seemingly had normal, healthy marriages and good kids, and they held down great jobs. Where was God and why was He putting up with this?

My introduction to alcohol confused and excited me. My parents and the surrounding Christian culture were vehemently opposed to all alcohol consumption. But now, I had finally found something that made my anxiety wash away for a bit. It was especially satisfying to have a relaxing drink after a long, stressful day of overtime work. Even after just one drink, I felt happy and relaxed in a way that I had never felt before. Granted, I was careful not to get drunk, as instructed by the apostle Paul. I had been raised as if any alcohol consumption would lead to orgies, bar fights, and abandoning your family. But even in the Bible, alcohol is enjoyed by many and is even considered a substance for celebration.

In one final attempt to hold my faith together, I applied to attend Moody Bible Institute for the spring of 2008. I decided to throw myself entirely into what I believed was the Lord’s calling to become a Christian apologist. Surely, if I went to a renowned Christian school, I could find the answers I needed to resolve these internal conflicts. Talking to other apologists who had studied philosophy and science and world religions would surely help me solve the bugs in my faith. As a result, getting that acceptance letter from Moody Bible Institute for the spring of 2008 brought quite a bit of hope. I had full confidence that, unlike the apostates I had met, I would solve these riddles in Christianity and, God willing, be able to present my findings to the world and help lead many people to Christ.

Shortly before I left for Chicago, the one apostate colleague pulled me aside and told me that he understood why I was going to Moody but that he thought attending was a mistake. I do not remember the entire conversation, but as I recall, he told me that it would just be better for me to study things on my own. And then he gave me a cautious, general warning about how these Christian schools teach rote ideologies that would just lead to my disillusionment. He said I had a promising career as a software engineer and that going to Moody Bible was a waste of time and money. He wished me the best in my endeavors, but I could see in his eyes that he knew what was coming next. Little did I know just how accurate his prediction would become.

# Chapter 12 - Moody Bible Institute

I remember the remarkable excitement I felt as I arrived at Moody Bible Institute in the spring of 2008. That semester, I would be joining my cousin Joseph, who also happened to be one of my best childhood friends. By the time I got to Moody, Joseph was already several semesters into his studies.

As I arrived in Chicago, I recall having a foreboding sense of an evil presence yet again. My previous experiences of sensing dark or demonic beings could maybe be explained away as like sleep paralysis. However, I experienced this while wide awake in the car—a larger and darker presence than had ever stalked me in Kansas or Colorado. I felt watched, as though something was warning me that I did not know what I was getting into. It felt like whatever evil presence existed in and around Chicago was darker than what I had grown up with. I told no one.

Meeting my new roommates for the first time was eye-opening. While Moody attracts students from all sorts of backgrounds, an inordinate number of the students in that era were from conservative homeschooled families. I was already coming to terms with just how sheltered I had been, and getting to know the other students made the disillusionment sting just that much more. There was an innocent game a lot of my dormmates played when new students arrived each semester. The goal was to spot the homeschooled students before ever talking to them. To my embarrassment, they spotted me before I spoke.

As a child, I trusted my parents and their decisions, but now I was palpably experiencing daily reminders that something was off about me. My conversational skills, my interests, my hobbies, and even my clothing were all a signal to others that I had lived a sheltered childhood and had somehow missed an entire period of life that was common for so many others. I suddenly felt ten years behind my friends, who had developed in ways I could only imagine. So I set myself the goal of reaching a point where nobody could tell that I had been homeschooled.

Throughout my first semester at Moody, I heard many disaster stories about other homeschooled attendees, some of whom completely lost it. One of the more popular stories was about a boy whose parents never let him watch any movies or television shows. When he arrived for his first semester at Moody, this kid discovered his roommate’s DVD collection and soon developed such a strong movie-watching addiction that he refused to leave his dorm room and flunked all his classes. Another student had become so conflicted over his addiction to pornography that he ended up in the emergency room after attempting to mutilate himself.

I was further alarmed by stories of students sneaking out of Moody at night to go to clubs or do other things prohibited by the code of conduct, and of students experimenting with sex. To make matters worse, I had my entire DVD collection stolen, most likely by another student. The environment floored me. I had actively chosen to go to a Christian school—and had given up a good paying tech job to attend—and had no interest in breaking the rules. If a person wanted to do these activities, why not go to a secular college? I could almost understand why someone would choose to do these types of activities if they were not going to a Christian school and were not trying to maintain their faith, but I could not for the life of me conceive of actively pursuing a degree at a Christian school only to throw yourself into this type of behavior. The vision I had been given of Moody being one of the “last good Christian schools in the nation” was collapsing.

Hearing so many of these stories, one after another, left me with massive FOMO, because so many others were out having secret fun while I was just studying and living a boring life on campus. They seemed to be fine living in casual sin, and their lives were not falling apart. In fact, they were enjoying themselves while also getting to participate in Christian ministry. Observing them reminded me of my secular coworkers back in Denver, who were living rather organized lives despite doing all the so-called bad things while I was being extremely straitlaced. How much of the Christian life was a charade? Was I trying too hard? Where was God in all of this?

Despite these setbacks during that first semester, I still felt I had a strong purpose. I was to become a Christian apologist. I was certain God was calling me into that ministry, and I envisioned being a true defender of the faith, alongside people like Josh McDowell and Lee Strobel and C.S. Lewis. I had seen so many wishy-washy Christians experimenting with normal worldly things, so I was starting to understand the allure of partying, sleeping around, and not worrying about the long and complex process of Christian dating and marriage. However, I could not fathom why anyone would abandon faith entirely. After all, I had experienced—and had heard so many stories—of spiritual encounters. Why in the world would someone be so foolish as to be an atheist?

I felt certain that God wanted me to reach atheists. I also knew that the apostle Paul had tried becoming all things to all people to win some to the gospel. I was also quite aware of how my sheltered upbringing was stunting my ability to relate to people who had grown up secular. Adding all this up, I decided to pray a prayer:

God, I feel that you want me to reach atheists, but I do not understand them. I am willing to do whatever you want to reach atheists, even if it means going so far as to become one myself.

In my first semester courses, I encountered new information about the Bible and church history that was enlightening but also increased my doubts. As I learned how the New Testament was developed, for instance, lots of pieces of information clicked into place, like a puzzle being solved. It started to make sense why the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John contained so many stories that did not line up perfectly. My classmates and I learned about the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), which obviously shared source material, and about the non-synoptic gospel of John, which had apparently been sourced differently. We learned about the dozens—if not hundreds—of fake writings within the early Christian era. We were introduced to pseudepigraphy, the practice of attributing your writing to a famous author to help sell your ideas to the masses, a practice that was quite common. As we were taught the history of these early Christian writings, I began to suspect the unreliability of some of the methods for dating them. Within a month, a fuller picture of the development of the earliest stages of Christianity was forming in my mind, and it was not nearly as neat and tidy as I had imagined. In fact, the one thing I could say with certainty by the end of that semester was that many of the claims Christians hold deeply are also deeply uncertain.

The Genesis class destabilized me most. Our professor was brilliant, and he dove into the scholarly material on that era of history with an inspiring passion. The content of the class surprised me the most, because I was learning things that contradicted what I had grown up believing. You might recall that my parents were subscribers to and supporters of Answers in Genesis, which firmly adheres to a literal six-day creation of the earth roughly ten thousand years ago. I had been taught that a plain reading of the text reveals that the world had been created in six twenty-four-hour periods followed by a day of rest and that the garden of Eden was a literal place on this planet. Anything less than a perfectly literal interpretation of the text is a deception of the devil, and anyone who says otherwise is actively helping to spread his lies.

To my surprise, our professor spent almost no time on the creation-versus-evolution debate. Instead, consistent with what I had learned about hermeneutics, he began by teaching us important contextual details for understanding how the original readers would have approached the text. To my joy, the literary structure of the book of Genesis is quite genius. In the ancient Near East, it was so expensive to produce writing materials that the written language was condensed so that it was easier to reproduce and faster for people to memorize. In words my fellow computer nerds will understand, much of the written material in the ancient Near East was compressed and encoded. 

Hebrew, for example, was written without vowels—only consonants—and without white space and even without any punctuation . There were no quotation marks, so a direct quote can be hard to distinguish from the writer’s point of view. Ancient people, restricted as they were in writing length, were not always as interested in exact quotes as we are today, and it was normal for them to paraphrase long conversations into a few sentences. And to make things easier to memorize, they often converted stories into styles of poetry we no longer even use in English. All of these methods combined make it extremely unlikely that any Hebrew passage should be taken as a full and exact account.

If it was such a common practice among the ancient near eastern cultures to summarize, paraphrase, and use poetry to express complex ideas, why were some Christians so adamant on interpreting Genesis 1 through the literal understanding of English words? Could it be that the reason so many educated Christians abandon a literal interpretation of various passages is because they learn that the passages make more sense when not taken literally?

Inspired, I spent much of my first semester going above and beyond the required study material. After classes, I would often return to my dorm room and dig in like a tick in front of my Dell laptop, spending countless hours studying. I listened to countless lectures by professors and reading scholarly white papers on every topic I could find related to Christianity, biology, archaeology, and anything related to the historicity of the Bible. I was soaking up as much information as possible so as not to miss a thing. And while this new information answered questions I had been mulling over, for each answer I received, two more questions would surface. I was starting to panic.

Following Jesus’ guidance in the Golden Rule to “do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” I figured that, if I expected atheists and secular thinkers to study Christianity, then I should study what they believe. Since I had full faith in the premise that “all truth is God’s truth,” then I could be assured that any truth I learned would lead me to understanding God that much more. That means that if I were to discover something uncomfortable but true, I should still accept it. After all, the doctrines of hell and eternal damnation make a lot of people uncomfortable, but Christians seem to have no problem teaching them and just expecting others to accept them. So then, I decided that if I encountered information from a secular source that made me uncomfortable but that appeared to be true, I would be a hypocrite to reject it. I felt it was important to be consistent, and I trusted that God would fully work things out since this was the direction He had called me.

# Chapter 13 – Crossing the Line

My time at Moody was not entirely a grind. Between classes and all my extracurricular study, I did find time for fun and hanging out with friends. We played video games and Settlers of Catan and chatted about girls. When we had the money, we went out to restaurants, and when we didn’t, we found creative ways to cook ramen noodles.

That first semester I took a mission trip to England, where we spent quite a bit of time in Manchester. This trip further exposed to me our sheltered upbringing in Kansas, and it opened me even more to the world of travel. One thing I noted on this trip was just how secular everyone was outside of the little church community we visited in England. How could entire communities of people function in relative peace without faith? Meanwhile, my host family gave us visiting students so much respect. They saw us as somehow shoring up the Christian faith by simply attending a school like Moody. I began to feel a weight of responsibility that I could not bear. Did these people who looked up to us understand just how deep the problems with their faith ran?

I felt like I was living two lives. On the one hand, I was telling people I was going to school because I wanted to be a Christian apologist. On the other hand, I was wrestling with gnawing doubts about the Christian faith. I felt like an imposter. If, after only one semester at a Bible college, I had already exceeded the studies of adult Christians who had been saved their entire life, how could any of them ever hope to relate to my doubts? If all these adult Christians championing my studies knew of these problems I was finding, would they remain in the faith?

I was leading another double life around this time, feeling increasingly isolated in my struggle with pornography. I was a healthy young male, frustrated by a lack of any permissible sexual outlet and a general confusion of how to relate to almost any woman. Every couple of weeks, a hormonal fit of desperation would drive me to search out porn, masturbate for relief, and then feel overwhelming shame for several days.

I had been raised in the purity culture era, influenced by books like I Kissed Dating Goodbye by Joshua Harris . The aim of Harris’s book was to expose the flaws in modern dating culture and guide young Christians to an appropriate response to it. The general message was that every aspect of romantic relationships should be focused on marriage and kids and, therefore, standard dating and flirting and all that should be pushed out of the way. Unfortunately, this meant that millions of sheltered Christian kids like me felt forced to suppress a lot of natural curiosity, while simultaneously remaining ignorant about hormones and sexual urges. For me, the result of purity culture was that I wound up incredibly ashamed of my desire for sex. 

My mind was flooding with confusion. My natural desires made a lot more sense when I did not try to mash them into the Christian mold created by trendy books. Marriage looked more and more like a trap, like something that would hold me back and make me miserable. What if I were to get married and the woman did not even like sex with me? Would I be stuck with her forever? So, like most men, when I could no longer hold out, I found my main source of relief in the proliferation of online pornography. This heavy struggle would soon lead to a deeply consequential meeting.

At the time, Moody Bible Institute implemented filters on students’ internet access, and a third strike for attempting to watch pornography would trigger a lock on a resident’s internet. Before the violator could have his access restored, he had to fess up to his resident advisor. Even though I was only giving in to watch pornography a couple times a month, as a tech guy, it did not take me long to figure out a way around the blocks, so I was able to avoid locking my own account.

As our dorm’s main computer guru, I set up a wireless router in my room, which enabled the guys on my floor to get internet in the floor’s kitchen and common area. Before then, we had only wired internet at our dorm room desks.

One day, my internet suddenly stopped. The cause did not require much investigation, just a sheepish confession from one of my friends. He had been using my Wi-Fi to look up pornography and triggered a lock on my personal internet.

In full embarrassment, I had to schedule a meeting with our dorm’s resident advisor. During our meeting, I explained my Wi-Fi setup and how an unnamed dormmate had locked my internet by watching pornography. Completely unfazed, he assured me it was okay—happens all the time—and he would restore my internet access.

Wait a minute… this happens all the time?

You might laugh, but I was genuinely surprised that students at a Bible college, so devoted to their faith that they desired to enter ministry, were watching pornography so frequently. I felt like I had entered the twilight zone. When I confessed that I, too, occasionally watched pornography, the RA advised me to pray and do my best not to watch it anymore. But there was no specific guidance on pornography addiction or how to overcome it.

Given how transparent and nonjudgmental he was, I proceeded to open to him about what I considered to be the more serious issue: my doubts concerning the Christian faith. I half expected that, as soon as I admitted my doubts about faith or my struggles with porn, some holy SWAT team would rappel from the ceiling and rush me off to an exorcism. Instead, I was met with genuine care and understanding. I told him about my skepticism of the Bible’s inerrancy and whether perhaps the Genesis account of creation might be non-literal. I had never shared these intellectual doubts with anyone, not to this extent anyway. Instead of responding with shock or a controlling attitude, he said that these doubts were common and that there might be some scholars or books that could help me navigate my shifting views. He implied that many Christians, even at Moody, do not believe in young-earth creationism or the complete inerrancy of the Bible.

On the surface, his advice might seem reassuring, but now my faith felt even more like a house of cards. I was being told that I could abandon critical doctrines—doctrines that were required for membership at my parent’s church—and that my faith would be fine. It might be true that the core of my faith could be fine, but my relationship with everyone back home certainly would not be! I was becoming one of those “liberal Christians” who was abandoning the fundamentalist views of my parents!

My fears were confirmed when I emailed a close family member to explain my shifting views, referencing some of the Christian documents I had been reading. In his response, he ignored everything I shared, including the documents I cited, and flatly stated that “maybe you do not really know the gospel [of Jesus].” He then laid out a rudimentary version the gospel, complete with cherry-picked verses, as though I were a stupid child who had never even read the Bible. This family member, with whom I had hundreds of conversations about faith, suddenly acted like I did not understand any of it simply because I was rethinking a few things. What insulted me most was his refusal to directly engage with the ideas I had written. Sadly, as I shared my faith journey with more Christians, his intellectually lazy response would prove to be the norm. 

As the spring semester progressed, I confessed my doubts to more people, including professors, and their responses never once drew me back toward faith. When I would lay out a direct problem with a Christian doctrine, their first reaction was typically confusion at my irritation with the problem. They would then give a canned Christian response that completely ignored all the reasoning and evidence I had presented. Let me give an example.

At this time, Moody Bible Institute was kickstarting an apologetics program, and I figured it would make sense to befriend the head of the new department.

One day, I discovered a biblical problem that I decided to present to this professor. In the Old Testament, God promises that the Messiah would come through King David’s lineage. As with all ancient cultures, kingship was assumed to be passed through males only. But it occurred to me that Jesus could not possibly be in the line of David because Jesus did not have a human father. Assuming the perspective of a secular person, I realized a much simpler explanation would be that Mary got pregnant and smart Christ-followers invented the idea of Jesus being in the line of David. Quite simply, they needed a virgin birth story, and they needed a line of David story. So, from the perspective of a skeptic, it would be much easier to believe the early Christians ignored the fact that lineage is passed through males. I was beginning to preemptively imagine secular arguments! How could I refute this line of reasoning?

I will never forget his response. For a while, he simply gazed into the distance, processing what I had just said. I don’t remember much of the conversation that followed, but he left me with a single statement ringing in my ears: “Josh, if those are the types of questions you are asking, maybe this is not the best school for you. You might be better attending someplace like Yale Divinity School.”

After getting over my initial shock, I felt a growing sense of betrayal. Part of why I was going to this school in the first place was my assumption that these professors would have some answers! Here, the head of the entire apologetics department did not even try to answer my question. What did it mean that he simply punted it and suggested I go to an even more secular school?

At this point, I gave up. In one semester at Moody Bible Institute, I had exhausted every intellectual avenue for finding answers to my questions. My faith in Christianity was dying and my faith in reason was growing.

# Chapter 14 - Anton LaVey

One day, while visiting a dormmate, I was surprised to see a copy of The Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey on his bookshelf. At the time, I knew next to nothing about Anton LaVey or satanism or any organized satanic church. In my mind, satanism was a weird thing practiced by witches and shamans in developing countries or bored teenagers out in the woods. Shocked, I asked why in the world a Christian at Moody Bible Institute would own a book like that.

He explained that for the sake of his ministry he felt he should read it to understand the thinking of various satanists, many of whom he told me claim to be atheists. My curiosity was piqued. How could someone be a satanist and an atheist? He knew I was interested in apologetics and witnessing to atheists, so he loaned it to me.

The book was eye-opening. In it, LaVey—the self-proclaimed high priest of the Church of Satan—claims that almost all satanism is an act. According to the so-called Black Pope himself, few satanists believe in a real being called Satan. Supposedly, it was all a farce to make Christians look silly. LaVey claimed that they did not actually perform sacrifices or eat babies, but instead just enjoyed consensual sex and orgies, some drinking and drugs and rock and roll, and general merriment. According to this book, the purpose of the satanic church was not to worship the Satan of the Bible but to view him as a fictional role model who resisted authoritarianism and embraced self-determinism. Turns out, satanism was all just a silly cosplay act by some atheists , and most Christians were too dumb or too incensed to realize it!

Already reeling in the embarrassment of having grown up so sheltered, I was now learning that even satanists do not really believe in Satan! Suddenly, all religion felt like a giant silly game that only uneducated people were playing while all the intelligent people were out having fun. How much of my life had been wasted on a lie?

With this fresh discovery added to my doubts, I knew that my faith and the fabric of my entire social network were at risk of crumbling. With the last bit of energy I could muster, I willed myself to believe that surely Christianity was real! I just needed to find one surefire piece of evidence—some theological silver bullet—to prove Christianity had some foundation in reality.

At this time, I had fully exposed myself to what seemed like every single argument put forward by the top Christian apologists over the past one hundred years. I had read every C.S. Lewis book I could get my hands on, including his lesser-known essays. I had studied Josh McDowell, Gary Habermas, and Lee Strobel. I had pored over papers and books by people like John Polkinghorne, Hugh Ross, and William Lane Craig. I had read Darwin’s Black Box by Michael Behe, and I had watched numerous debates featuring Mike Licona and Stephen C. Meyer. In an act of desperation, I even ventured out a bit and learned from some Catholic apologists. I was nearing the end of my rope. 

However, even if all the fancy intellectual arguments were useless, I knew that the entire Christian faith was still dependent on one thing: miracles. If miracles were not real, then none of Jesus’ ministry was real. If miracles were real, however, then perhaps at least some of the miracles recorded about Jesus were accurate and so Christianity could still be true in some sense. Perhaps, if I could just find solid evidence for one good miracle, that might be enough for me to hold on to the faith!

# Chapter 15 - Miracles

By some miracle (pun intended), my childhood spiritual experiences were still shoring up my tattered faith. The memories of dreams and the feelings of recurring demonic presence were more convincing to me than any logical argument could ever be. Surely, miracles and supernatural experiences evinced the presence of something in another dimension. While I was convinced of the reality of these experiences—the demonic visitations, my dream about Jesus, the man at the funeral, and so on—it was an entirely different task to convince others that what happened to me was indeed spiritual. How could I possibly do that?

Before moving on, I think that clarifying some definitions might be useful. When I originally began studying Christian apologetics, my primary assumption had been that most miracle claims in need of defending came from Christian churches and the Bible. However, I quickly discovered that skeptics tend to be consistently skeptical about all claims that cannot be proven by scientific method. In other words, skeptics view any claim of force or being unexplainable by physics or biology as suspicious. Ghosts, UFOs, angels, demons, miracles, poltergeists, prophetic dreams, visions, resurrections, and such experiences are all lumped into the same category of paranormal and in need of proof. So, throughout this chapter, the words paranormal, supernatural, and miracle, while distinct in meaning, will have significant overlap.

For this book, I use the word paranormal to refer to incomprehensible events that do not have a known source or cause. A poltergeist—think pots and pans flying around a kitchen—would be an example of a paranormal event since no known laws of physics can cause pots and pans to fly around a room or doors to open and close in a windless room. Therefore, if no known physical force causes these things to happen, then these events can be labeled paranormal.

I define supernatural as any phenomena in which a spiritual being or force is claimed to have interacted with our physical world. Prophecies are supernatural, resurrections are supernatural, and witchcraft is supernatural. In short, every religion that alleges an interactive god or spiritual being or interdimensional life force makes claim to the supernatural.

A paranormal event, then, becomes a supernatural event when someone claims to know that a spiritual being or force is causing it to happen. So, a skeptic might consider a poltergeist paranormal because it defies explanation but cannot be attributed to an exact source. But a Christian might claim to know that the event is caused by demons and, therefore, call it supernatural.

For Christians in the Midwestern US, where I grew up, the word miracle almost always refers to the Christian God—Jesus—or some angel or saint using godly power to effect a positive change in someone’s life or as a sign. According to this definition, a haunted house would not be considered a miracle. Jesus’ resurrection, however, would be paranormal, supernatural, and miraculous. 

Initially, since I was studying Christian apologetics—and following the guidance of popular apologists like the apostle Paul and Josh McDowell—my first goal was to prove the resurrection of Jesus. After all, the entire foundation of Christianity relies on Jesus’ being sent from God. Supernatural evidence for his incarnation includes the star of the magi (Christmas star), the visions of John the Baptist, Jesus’ miraculous healings and signs, and the symbolism of his death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven. If any of these claims are false, then Christianity at best contains large misunderstandings and at worst is a web of lies.

A first major problem with the claims of Jesus’ miracles is that the source texts for all these events were written nearly two thousand years ago, during a time when people were deeply ignorant or uneducated. Many people at this time believed the earth was flat, that planets were “wandering [rebellious] stars” because they moved around so quickly, and that lightning was a special type of fire sent from the gods. Can we really trust these people’s reports of miraculous events? The skeptic might point to the passage where Jesus says that the mustard seed is the smallest of seeds and make a fair point that even Jesus himself did not have a good understanding of the natural world! If Jesus cannot be trusted to be accurate about how seeds work, how can the stories of his miracles be believed?

A second major problem concerns the timing, method, and transmission of the written texts that we do have. There is significant evidence that the four recorded gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—were written at least several decades after the events they report. And this was in an era with no recording devices. Memories fade and human bias creeps in. Surely, errors would infiltrate the stories as they were told and retold over the years. Additionally, as the texts were copied and transmitted over those first hundred years, evidence suggests that changes and additional errors made their way into the writings. Some of the alterations are small, but others are big enough to have given many scholars deep pause. Some textual copies clearly indicate that the scribes were willing to bend the text toward their theological bias .

A third major problem with the miraculous claims of the gospels is that the gospels themselves contain significant differences. For example, the timeline in the Gospel of John varies quite a bit with the timelines found in Mark, Matthew, and Luke. Additionally, a careful reading of what are dubbed the Synoptic Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke reveals that they clearly were sourced from the same material; however, Matthew and Luke sometimes seem to add information that seems suspect.

One example of added material gave me a lot of concern at this time. In the Gospel of Mark, which is universally accepted to be the oldest of the gospels, we find this passage:

“Sighing deeply in His spirit, He [Jesus] said, “Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation!”” (Mark 8:12, NASB)

The oldest gospel clearly states that Jesus says no sign would be given to the Pharisees. However, the story is told slightly differently in the later gospel Matthew, in which Jesus says,

“yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet; for just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” (Matthew 12:39b–40, NASB)

The older gospel states unequivocally that Jesus was not going to give a sign, but the latter book contradicts this by adding that Jesus would give a sign. To the skeptic this is evidence that Christians felt the need to modify their stories of Jesus. Christians needed to invent instances where Jesus predicted his own crucifixion, and this is one example where they added to a quote of Jesus to make it look like he did so.

This is not the only problem in this passage. Jesus claims that he would be in the belly of the earth for three days and three nights. But if Jesus died on Good Friday and rose from the dead on Sunday morning, then only two nights are accounted for, and not three full days. Endless treatises have been written on this problem, with some people suggesting Jesus died on Wednesday or Thursday. Others claim that the hours of darkness immediately following Jesus’ passing should be considered the first night. Regardless, the simple problem remains. It sure looks like Matthew—or whoever added that small change to Mark’s account—missed something. Was it three days and three nights or not? And if someone is strict about 24-hour days in Genesis 1, why not be super strict about 24-hour days here? The reason is that people become emotionally attached to a religious narrative and defend it against new observations.

Exhausted by mental gymnastics, by the end of my first semester at Moody, I accepted the Bible has errors. But now a new doubt had surfaced: it appeared that some of these errors were intentional retellings to prop up Christian narratives.

As far as I had studied, the reliability of biblical texts, including those detailing Jesus’ miracles, is in doubt. Some apologists use the argument that ancient Jewish scribes were trustworthy, but even the Bible itself disagrees! The prophet Jeremiah claimed the scribes of his time were dishonest (see Jeremiah 8:8), and even Jesus is recorded as saying he did not trust the people assigned to handle the scriptures (Luke 11:52)!

Given what I considered to be clear evidence that some passages in the gospels were manipulated to prop up Christianity, I concluded the stories described in the gospels were impossible to prove. Naturally, all supernatural claims in the Bible are impossible to prove using any modern methods. All one has are inductive arguments (which are based on probabilities) or pushing emotional buttons to convince someone the stories are real. My next idea, then, was to see if modern miracles could be verified. If a modern miracle can be proven, then we at least can say the miracles are possible.

Miracles often start with people claiming an observation of an interaction by a powerful being—be it God, Jesus, Mary, a saint, or an angel. How can we prove that a non-physical being is the source of an alleged miracle? The obvious proof would be for the being itself to consistently and publicly appear and take responsibility for the miracle. But this never happens. This is extremely important data; I racked my brain as to why this was the case. Religious people lower their standards for spiritual beings to a point they would never give to other humans! At the time, it sure looked like the best explanation was that the reason non-physical beings do not consistently show up to verify their identity or powers is that they do not exist.

Naturally, there could be reasons we do not understand as to why spiritual beings appear to be inconsistent in their apparitions. There might be rules or laws governing their interactions with humans that limit the ways and means and times of their appearing. But why do they not just outline these laws to us in a nice, clear outline?

Baffled, like many others, I concluded maybe there is the possibility that we could capture a miracle on a camera or some other recording device.

Sadly, for as long as we have had photography and audio equipment, it has been possible to manipulate recordings. Every miracle that includes some form of documentation turns into an endless cycle of trying to prove the legitimacy of the recorded medium. The Shroud of Turin, the supposed burial garment of Jesus, is one such example of a physical recording that advocates have spent an inordinate amount of time attempting to confirm. But the best physical evidence in the world has little to no effect on a skeptic who has determined the claim is a hoax. And the further we get from the origin of the evidence, the easier it is to claim a hoax has occurred.

Another problem is the prevalence of phony healing preachers and prophets. Within the Pentecostal community, in particular, scams continually resurface like clockwork. One of these scams is the leg-lengthening trick, in which the so-called healer first convinces a person that his or her legs are different lengths and then, while praying, moves the person’s legs in such a way that it appears one leg is growing. This trick is extremely easy to pull off, and it primes a gullible audience for believing the healer’s later claims of having cured people of their blindness and deafness and all sorts of illnesses.

When I was young, I had a trip to the Kansas State Fair and attended a hypnotist’s show. During this show, the hypnotist asked people from the audience to come up. Some of these people were friends of mine, so I knew they were not plants. The hypnotist explained that about one third of the population is capable of being hypnotized. Sure enough, he had to dismiss about two thirds of the crowd because his trick did not work on them. For the remaining third, it was baffling watching them follow his instructions. He convinced the hypnotized that he was invisible and picked up a young girl. The hypnotized group panicked, thinking the little girl was going to float away. It was one of the most amazing displays of a mind trick I have ever seen. The hypnotist explained that many humans are susceptible to suggestion if they just give over their will to another.

Could it be that the churches where these types of “healings” are regularly performed merely attract people who are most easily hypnotized and influenced in this fashion? Maybe it is not so much the working of the Holy Spirit as it is a genetic predisposition to being mentally duped.

Furthermore, what seems miraculous may be a natural phenomenon. For example, if your headache dissipates after taking ibuprofen and praying to God, which of those two actions is responsible for your healing? In other words, could it be that people who regularly pray simply experience normal life events rather than God’s intervening in their daily lives? Could it be that praying to God has about as much effectiveness as carrying a lucky rabbit's foot? The only way to prove the futility of the rabbit’s foot would be to stop carrying the rabbit’s foot. Perhaps the only way to disprove prayer is to stop praying and see what happens?

Internally at this point I was nearly in a full-blown panic. The Bible clearly had errors in the text, there was clearly evidence that religious devotees would manipulate the data to prop up their beliefs, and now all the miracles recorded in the Bible and in the modern era were potentially not real. What I truly needed was proof of just one definite interaction between a spiritual being and our physical reality. The internet contains countless stories of ghosts, poltergeists, miraculous healings, curses, witchcraft, prophetic visions and dreams, near-death experiences involving angels and demons and other such beings, and what some have termed “glitches in the matrix.” I knew that if I could find valid proof of just one of these stories that it might still be possible for at least some part of Christianity to be true.

Discovering this proof would determine not only whether I was going to continue attending this school but also whether I was going to continue living my life as a Christian.

I scoured the internet, searching through hundreds and hundreds of stories and claims of miracles from every religion around the world, in every corner of the internet I knew to search. I spent countless late nights in that dimly lit dorm room, my homework completed and my roommate fast asleep, straining at my laptop screen to find any lifeline for my floundering faith. I searched every YouTube video and Reddit post I could find, desperate to discover one solid piece of evidence. I kept coming up empty-handed.

My research revealed that every religion and tribe of people throughout history have claims of miracles. Nearly all ancient cultures contain stories of intelligent beings showing up and giving them a head start in society. Christianity taught me that, if these stories were true, they were deceptive inventions by fallen angels pretending to be aliens or gods. But why would a good god allow all these cultures to be so incredibly deceived and to die generation after generation without receiving the truth?

Another stumbling block that emerged from my research were the many stories of miraculous experiences and supernatural encounters within the Catholic faith. Nobody had ever told me that Catholicism’s beliefs in Mary are reinforced every couple years by sightings of a Marian apparition appearing to people. Nobody had ever told me about Padre Pio and the various saints throughout history, who claimed to have received the stigmata—spontaneously appearing wounds resembling the wounds of Christ. How were these stories missed by the entire Protestant world I grew up in?

I was also shocked by the preponderance of modern-day claims of interactions with UFOs and extraterrestrial beings. Through my research, I consumed all the witness testimonies I could find from the original Steven Greer Disclosure Project videos from back in May of 2001. There were stories of orbs and UFOs appearing to people and performing odd maneuvers. Some of these people claim to have been abducted by alien beings and to have had implants put in them that doctors later physically removed. There were stories of grotesque cattle mutilations near where observers had allegedly seen UFOs. Professional veterinarians and wildlife experts insist that these mutilations could not have been made by humans.

I watched endless videos of supposed exorcisms and miraculous healings and ghost-hunting excursions. I watched videos from the Middle East of alleged interactions with Jinn—an Islamic term for spirits who play tricks on people. I even watched videos of strange things people had “accidentally” caught on camera. But with every story I read and every video I watched, I was baffled by the fuzziness of the evidence. It did not matter what type of being the person was claiming to have interacted with; there was always a frustrating lack of solid physical proof. How could this be possible? If any of these thousands—if not millions—of stories were true, how could they all leave no verifiable physical evidence? I was starting to find it much easier to imagine that most of this stuff existed only in people’s heads and not in the real world.

Over and over, I was disappointed by the poor and incomplete data cited to support supernatural claims. At school we were required to source our claims meticulously, but when it came to supernatural experiences most people were not meticulous at all. Someone would claim the occurrence of a healing but then could not provide substantiating medical documents. UFO abductees would magically have their rock-solid evidence suddenly disappear without explanation. So often, Christians would claim a miracle had occurred where it was just a mentalist performing a trick.

By the end of my research, I concluded most people are willing to suspend critical thinking—and intellectual honesty—to continue clinging to their prior beliefs. Christians are supposed to be honest and humble people, and yet so many of the ones claiming to emulate Christ were being duped and dishonest in their supernatural claims. It broke my heart.

Some may balk at my comingling of all these phenomena. How can I mix aliens and Christian miracles in the same research? Initially, I did not see them as the same category, but over time I observed similarities in how the people who make paranormal or supernatural claims described their experiences.

For example, independent of religion, people often describe going into a fixed trance (hypnosis?). Some people who claim to have had visions say they experience a trancelike state and are frozen in place. Many of the miracles reported within the Catholic Church involve this phenomena, especially those that involve Marian apparitions. The Bible records stories like this as well, such as Paul’s falling into a trance and having a vision in Acts 10:10. In many of these stories, external observers witness the receiver of the vision freeze, and in some cases, the seer is incapable of being hurt while the trance is in progress. These trancelike states are not limited to Christianity. In many cases of UFO sightings, people who are reportedly abducted also fall into a trance that can be observed by others. Many who experience sleep paralysis claim to be frozen in place with terror while they observe beings in their room. There is a strong overlap in the physical response of humans to hypnosis and to spiritual visions and to UFO and extraterrestrial encounters. Curious.

Furthermore, research has shown that these states can be induced through drugs. It is true that our minds can reach these same or similar states simply by injecting chemicals into our body. Throughout history, many people have been accidentally drugged. Ergot poisoning, for example, occurs when people ingest a hallucinatory fungus that grows on rye. In other words, people sometimes experience exotic mental states unintentionally.

Maybe everyone who claims to have experienced strange paranormal phenomena were simply experiencing an accidental mental break? If it is possible for mental illness or accidental ingestion of drugs to cause a transcendent experience, maybe this is a much more elegant explanation for spiritual visions and the like? This certainly would explain why the millions of wild paranormal experiences people have never describe a single cohesive narrative!

My faith in Christianity was almost completely broken by this new explanation of the “miraculous”. I was beginning to accept that all religious, supernatural, and paranormal experiences made more sense if we simply allowed for the possibility of mental illness, accidental hallucinations, personal bias, or just plain old human mistake. After all, I had observed a person who was convinced his dog would rise from the dead after three days, so I knew that people could convince themselves of just about any absurd thing.

I found it far easier at this point to believe that the book of Revelation had been produced by a man who was simply malnourished or had accidentally eaten a hallucinogen than to believe his prophetic vision was divinely inspired. It was easier to believe that much of what we find in the Bible originated from an expansive version of the telephone game. And it was certainly easier to imagine that the legendary stories of a Jewish man named Jesus had been embellished over time, especially given that the first written reports of his miracles and resurrection emerged nearly thirty years after the fact.

But what of my own spiritual experiences? How was I to explain them?

One evening while studying UFO phenomena in my room, for instance, I had that distinct, recognizable feeling of being watched by a dark, demonic entity. But this time, something shifted in my perception. Instead of it being something dark and demonic, I imagined I was being observed by what felt like a gray alien. In a flash of insight, it all clicked. This recurring feeling of being observed—or haunted—must be entirely in my head! Did I ever in my entire life have any physical proof that it was not in my head? Now that I was studying aliens alone in my room, I felt like an alien was watching me. Like a child who has just watched a scary movie and is now afraid of monsters under his bed, I was an adult experiencing the same phenomena. Every parent knows that if little children shove their heads full of scary stories, they are going to have nightmares and imagine horrors that are not there. Likewise, if we adults shove our heads full of beliefs in interdimensional invisible beings, such as angels and demons, of course we are going to have visions and sense presences on occasion!

One day, I entered my dorm’s elevator, pressed the floor-six button, and then turned to wait for the door to close. The close-door button in this elevator did not work, so I did not bother pressing it. The door would eventually close. As I was waiting, another student, distracted by his headphones, mindlessly entered the elevator and pressed the close-door button. The door, of course, did not immediately close. With his music pumping, he mindlessly and repeatedly pressed the close-door button. Annoyed, I thought, “That’s dumb. The door was going to close anyway! And now you are going to think your pressing the button is what caused it to close!” A mixture of embarrassment and enlightenment washed over me: I had just described prayer.

Christians pray for things that are going to happen eventually.

 “Lord, please help me get into this college.”
“God, will you please help this cold go away.”
“God, I pray that my favorite sports team wins!” 

If a person prays for something generic, as in the above prayers, how could any of us know whether repeatedly pressing the button of prayer is working? Maybe your cold was going to subside regardless, maybe you were going to get into that college anyway, and statistically speaking, your favorite sports team was bound to win again eventually. Imagine that a healthy person went to bed every night praying that she would wake up with her head still attached. Just because she wakes up the next day with her head still attached does not mean God has miraculously answered her prayer. I figured the only way to know whether prayer works is to pray an extremely daring prayer once and then stop praying. Soon, I would put this theory to the test by praying one of the most insane prayers I have ever prayed in my life.

# Optional Chapters 16-19

The next few chapters outline some intellectual arguments I wrestled with during this period of my life, arguments stemming from questions that the Bible and Christian doctrine seemed unable to answer. These arguments—and several others like them—ultimately led me to atheism.

I include these chapters to highlight that some of the arguments against common Christian positions are quite strong. I want you, perhaps a Christian reader, to contemplate your own faith and to be exposed to areas where your own view of the faith might need rethinking. If you are an atheist, these chapters are to clearly demonstrate I understood quite well your position.

If you are not interested in intellectual or logical arguments, feel free to skip this section of the book. The narrative story continues at chapter 19.

## Chapter 16 – Heaven is a Fantasy!

In an earlier chapter, I recollected a thought experiment I performed as a child, in which I tried imagining a new world that did not borrow any concepts from our known world. I quickly discovered that all things, like shapes and planets and organic bodies, are concepts we discover from our experiences in this physical existence. Try as I could, I found it impossible to imagine a single concept that was independent from observations I had made in my physical body. I concluded there is truly no new imaginary world. All fantasy worlds—whether in books, movies, or children’s imaginations—are just remixes of preexisting concepts in our universe. Stated another way, one can predict that any human-invented fantasy world will just be a remix of concepts from our own experience.

While studying science books and white papers, I was thrilled to learn more about our universe. However, when I began to compare these concepts to traditional ideas within Christianity, a huge conceptual problem emerged. It appeared that Christian claims about the spiritual realm resembled a fictional fantasy world.

I noticed that descriptions of the spiritual realm, even within the Bible, appeared to be mere remixes of our earthly experience. Angels are described as having wings yet supposedly exist in a dimension without air. Why do some angels have swords, when swords are invented to split physical objects? Why would heaven have golden streets, other than to impress an ancient people who saw gold as the most valuable physical substance? Gold is soft and easily scratched, so it would make a terrible road! It appeared that ancient authors were simply remixing concepts they had experienced on earth into an imaginary spiritual world.

But Josh, you might ask, don’t concepts like unconditional love and the glory of God exist independent of our physical experience on this planet? It may very well be that certain concepts supersede the physical, but even those concepts typically appropriate and modify our earthbound feelings or experiences. The glory of God, for example, is often described as an unapproachable light. The unoriginality of unconditional love is betrayed by its very name: it is the inverse of conditional love, something we humans know all too well. Sadly, I discovered that most of our spiritual ideals are simply the inverse of negative experiences in this physical realm. I hypothesized that all descriptions of heaven or hell are simply exaggerations of good and bad things in our physical experience. If we were horses, heaven would just be the place where the best hay exists and farmers are always happy and never build fences.

But what sort of evidence might validate this hypothesis? Well, when fantasy writers imagine a world that simply modifies core properties of our world—such as subtracting gravity, adding magic, or creating a new element—one sure way to spot the story’s so-called inventions is that they inevitably lead to contradictions. Likewise, if aspects of Christianity are the result of human imagination, we can expect to find conceptual contradictions in the overarching plot. One biblical story in which plenty of people have found these contradictions is the creation account of Genesis 1 and 2.

In my time of spiritual wandering, I landed on a contradiction that led me to believe the Bible’s creation story must have been invented, not divinely revealed. This contradiction has to do with the law of conservation of energy (LOCE) and the second law of thermodynamics (LOT). The LOCE is the principle that, in a closed system, energy is always conserved. The LOT states that entropy always increases. In simpler English, there are laws baked into our entire universe that explain why we must work to accomplish things and why things are always falling apart.

These two laws apply not only to inanimate objects like coffee but to all living physical creatures, which require an input of energy to continue living and which fall apart over time. Simply put, if living creatures do not have a consistent input of energy, they die. They must consume material that is digestible, such as food or absorbed nitrogen. The volume of digestible material within every environment is limited, and therefore, every environment has a maximum number of living creatures that it can support. Once the wolves eat all the prey, the wolves die.

When there are limited resources, animals fight. The animals that win the fight get the resources and therefore survive or reproduce. Think about the birds that visit your bird feeder. Their instincts drive them to protect the source of their energy, through chirping, squawking, pecking, and clawing. That grackle is not going to allow any sparrows to get in its way! 

All living beings have internal organs that exist because of these two laws. Makes sense. They have mouths to bring food into the body, stomachs to break down that food, and other organs to dispose of the waste we cannot digest. All species of animals have features specifically set up to protect them from predators or to help them deceive their prey. In fact, we identify some creatures entirely by their predatory or defensive features. The chameleon blends into its environment to deceive its prey. The bombardier beetle defends itself against predators with a sort of built-in chemical weapon. The same goes for the skunk. Scavengers, like vultures and catfish, have digestive systems that allow them to consume decaying organic matter. Think about that for a moment: there are animals that exist only to eat dead things.

These two laws explain why we need to eat food, why our bodies give off heat, and why we feel uncomfortable in extreme environments. It also explains why many creatures have sharp claws and teeth and an instinct to fight other creatures. Unfortunately, these two laws also explain why we feel pain, hunger, and jealousy. Pain is our body telling us that our current environment is not a good fit for our energy conservation. Hunger is our body telling us we need more input energy. Jealousy is sometimes our brain’s warning that someone else might be hogging energy resources and should be stopped.

This brings us to the contradiction inherent in the concept of a perfect world. If the garden of Eden described in Genesis were a perfect paradise for humans, then it would be free of pain, hunger, and jealousy. Many Christians even believe that all death was absent from the garden. For this to be true, in the Garden of Eden both laws must not have existed.

According to a plain reading of Genesis, the garden of Eden was a real physical location on planet Earth, located among rivers that were known in the ancient Near East and that still exist today, such as the Euphrates River. Whoever wrote the story used real names of real places because they wanted the reader to imagine the garden of Eden as existing in relation to those earthly features.

If the garden of Eden was indeed a real place where nothing died, then it follows that the two laws cited above were not part of God’s original design and whatever the garden of Eden was, it was not our known universe. Because every living being possesses either defense mechanisms to deceive predators or traits to allow them to attack prey, it also follows that the entire structure of all biological systems were not necessary in the garden of Eden where death was not possible. Are we truly willing to propose that at the moment Adam and Eve sinned, God instantly invented the two laws cited above and then reinvented every living creatures DNA from scratch to work in the environment? Did he kill all the birds and make new ones or did all eagles and hawks suddenly develop keen eyesight and sharp talons? Did Adam and Eve’s sin fundamentally shift the entire physical structure of the universe? Did God install gas glands in all the skunks because Adam and Eve sinned? Did the bombardier beetle suddenly have all the DNA for its main feature because Adam bit into that fruit? If we believe that there was no death in the garden of Eden, there were two creations. The first one was “very good”, and then God reinvented all known life entirely to account for the LOCE and LOT.

We are running into the types of contradictions one would expect to find in a fictional fantasy story! But maybe we can try to resolve it anyway?

Let us propose that these two laws did not exist prior to Adam and Eve’s fall. Since there was no need for input energy for a living being, then life would not have required food to live. They would not have needed digestive systems to filter out the bad stuff. But Genesis says that God planted trees that were “good for food” (Genesis 2:9). Why did creatures need food before the fall? The LOCE and LOT must have existed in the garden! And if the LOCE existed in the pre-fall garden, then living creatures were subject to starvation and death. Some paradise!

Okay, maybe we can solve this problem by proposing that food in the garden of Eden was readily available and evenly distributed so that every creature was always perfectly fed and therefore no creature would ever die.

But this proposal does not fit the story either, because of another fantastical element in the creation story: the Tree of Life! Adam and Eve were granted access to a special tree whose fruit would keep them alive. The author implies that death was possible in the garden but could be avoided by eating from this one tree. After their expulsion from the garden, Adam and Even were prohibited from accessing the Tree of Life (Genesis 3:22–24). Without this special tree, they could no longer avoid death. Death apparently was possible, you just had to eat from that tree to avoid it.

Interestingly, the Tree of Life is given only to Adam and Eve. Nothing is said about the other animals also needing to eat from this tree to live. Why are Adam and Eve allowed to eat from this special tree but all the other animals are not? Is this because animals were able to die in the garden of Eden? It sure seems like the author was implying that animals would still die, but that humans had a special privilege if they could eat from this tree.

It feels like the author is implying that the Law of Conservation of Energy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics did exist in the garden of Eden, both before and after the fall. It also feels like the author of Genesis 2 is inventing a world where the fun part of the LOCE and LOT (like good food) still exist but the bad stuff (like dying) is avoidable.

These are the exact types of contradictions we would expect of a fictional author inventing a fantasy world that is perfect for humans. Conclusion: the author of Genesis 2 was writing using mythological language and thinking and not describing a literal event because the literal event is full of internal contradictions.

All these same problems apply to any concept of heaven! Just consider food, for example. Will we eat in heaven? If so, will we need to grow the food ourselves? If our bodies in heaven are perfect, why would we need food at all? If there is food in heaven, does this mean we will have physical bodies that can digest it? Will our heavenly guts contain bacteria needed to digest food? Will that bacteria die? And assuming our physical heavenly bodies can digest food, then where does the waste go? Are there bathrooms in heaven? Is there a sewage system? Will the lower-level residents of heaven be assigned to work in the sewage plant? The questions are endless as soon as you stop and think literally about things. What about crying? Revelation says that God will wipe away tears. Wait a minute, we will have tears in heaven? Why? Tears exist to flush bad stuff out of our eyes and flow into lymph nodes which drain the bad stuff out. Why do we even have tear ducts and lymph nodes in heaven if it is a perfect place?

The more I pondered the data found in the Bible and how it relates to our understanding of our world, the more confident I became that the bookends of the Bible, both the Garden of Eden and Heaven, were nothing more than fantasy worlds invented by hopeful humans who were just imagining a reality without the bad stuff but retaining all the good stuff.

## Chapter 17 – Bible Errors

Even the most conservative Christians will agree that, assuming the broadest definition of error, the Bible has errors. But most Christian denominations believe there exists at least one version of the Bible that is to some degree inerrant – or without error. They just disagree on which version of the Bible is inerrant and to what degree it has no errors.

When enrolling at Moody Bible Institute, I believed I would encounter airtight arguments and archeological findings that validated the inerrancy of the Bible. Based on the promises of some Christian apologists, I was expecting to find scholarly articles proving the factual accuracy of every biblical statement. I was expecting confirmation that the Bible is a perfect book.

My first couple of times through the Bible, I spotted incredible patterns that strengthened my faith. However, the more I read, the more I started to see troubling patterns in the text. Numerous contradictions emerged, a couple of which I will share in this chapter. But first a little context about the language of the Bible.

Scholars tend to agree that ancient Hebrew writers put considerable effort into structuring written stories with mnemonic devices, which made it easier for listeners to memorize passages at a time when physical copies of texts were extremely limited. Many of these advanced mnemonic devices are no longer used in modern English, so we do not spot them when we read the text. When I first learned about chiasms and toledots in my Genesis class at Moody, the stories in Genesis made more sense! 

I also learned that Hebrew authors commonly used words in ways English writers do not. For instance, a Hebrew author might emphasize a point by repeating the same sequence of words multiple times throughout a story, or even across multiple related stories. In the book of Genesis, for example, the verb combo see and take is repeated. Eve sees and takes the fruit (3:6). The sons of god see the daughters of men and take them (6:2). Pharoah sees and takes Abram’s wife Sarai (12:15). Patterns like this reveal themes the author is trying to make across the text and communicate lessons to the reader. After all, just because you see that something is good, does not mean that it is.

Another quirk of ancient languages and myths is that the meaning of people’s names were often part of the story. In Hebrew, for example, the name Adam means “mankind,” so to the ancient Hebrew audience, the words Adam and mankind would have overlap. There are places where it is not fully clear whether the word “adam” refers to Adam of Genesis 2 or to “mankind” as a whole. Likewise, Eve’s name means “life” or “life-giver” because she would have been seen as the mother of humanity. Genesis 3—which recounts conversations between Adam, Eve, God, and the serpent—contains a lot of plays on words. The late Dr. Michael Heiser loved to point out that the word for serpent in Hebrew could also be used to refer to a powerful spiritual being, because the name itself contains internal euphemisms.

To make matters more complex, within the ancient Near East, language dialects shifted over time. In the same way that modern English evolves as each generation invents new words and phrases, ancient languages were ever-changing. Historicists and linguists have managed to trace many of the ancient Near Eastern languages, like Sumerian and Hebrew, to their common roots. Words were shared between cultures and those words shifted in meaning over time. One great example of this is an extremely prominent word in Hebrew: elohim. The word is often translated as “God”, but the word itself is plural. In Psalm 82, the plural word “Elohim” is used to refer to multiple gods. But other times the plural word “Elohim” seems confusingly to refer to the one true God (see Genesis 1:26). The translator must use context to make an educated assessment. But ultimately the point remains that in some cases there is confusing ambiguity because language and assumptions about words change over time – even in Hebrew.

As if to add to the mess, the story of Genesis involves an event that would have radically altered languages, disrupting whatever language was used in Genesis 1 and 2. The Tower of Babel explicitly states that languages were confused so that humans could not understand eachother. So what language was used before that? If Hebrew was not the original language of the planet, then it means that every quote from God is at best a translation from the original language of creation. We do not have the original words!

The Genesis Rabbah, a fifth-century midrash that includes some of the earliest known rabbinical commentary on the book of Genesis, resolves this problem by suggesting that Hebrew was the one language to survive the Tower of Babel. As a result, Jewish literature often considers Hebrew the language of creation.

To muddy the waters even further, the book of Genesis—particularly the first twelve chapters—contain references to places that did not exist and Hebrew words and phrases that would make no sense for Moses to write. Due to the complexity of issues like this, most scholars now reject the idea that Moses was the lone author of the Torah.

Let me give one final example that I found to be impossible to resolve and that is super important to the Christian faith. In Exodus 6:3, God tells Moses his name, the well-known “I am that I am”. God explicitly states that this name of Yahweh  was never shared with the patriarchs:

I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jason as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD [YAHWEH] I did not make myself fully known to them.

It seems appropriate that God would wait until His dramatic deliverance of the Hebrews from Egyptian slavery to reveal His I AM name. We run into a problem, however, when we read Genesis 4:26:

Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of the LORD [YAHWEH].

Did God wait to reveal his name of Yahweh to Moses or did people begin calling on the name of Yahweh a thousand of years before that? Which is it?

To this conundrum, the fundamentalist-leaning Christian might say, “Well, I just trust God’s Word, and all this scholarly stuff is just distracting from the clear truth contained within.” With all humility, I must respond to this statement with a simple question: what clear truth? Is it clear that the patriarchs in early Genesis knew about the name Yahweh, or is it clear that God first revealed it to Moses?

Problems like this—and hundreds more—were tearing my faith apart at the seams. I had told so many people I was planning to become a Christian apologist, yet I had no intention of lying about my faith or ignoring the data. Sure, I could just avoid these controversial topics in the Bible, but people who hide problems are shady and are usually trying to sell a faulty product. Christianity began to feel to me like a faulty product and most apologists were just there to cover up the problems to sell books and get donations.

## Chapter 18 – Invalid Biblical Canon

In the tradition in which I grew up, it was taken for granted that the sixty-six books of the Bible were the only truly inspired written words of God. No other books were similarly inspired and so could not be trusted to contain the same level of truth. It was not until I started attending Moody Bible Institute that I noticed references in the New Testament to extrabiblical texts, primarily ancient Jewish writings. This is not new information to the scholarly community, but it certainly seemed new to me!

Many who hold a rigid inerrantist position often site 2 Timothy 3:16 as a source text on the divine inspiration of the Protestant Bible. In this verse, the apostle Paul asserts, “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.” However, just eight verses earlier, Paul references two characters named Jannes and Jambres, who supposedly opposed Moses. But the names Jannes and Jambres do not appear anywhere in the Old Testament. So, where did Paul learn of these characters?

The only known reference to Jannes and Jambres in all ancient literature is a little-known book called the Apocryphon of Jannes and Jambres. The early church father Origen of Alexandria contends that Paul was quoting from this book:

And the Apostle Paul, in the Second Epistle to Timothy, mentions Jannes and Jambres, saying, 'As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth' [2 Tim. 3:8]. These names are not found in the books of the Old Testament, but in an apocryphal book entitled Jannes and Jambres. This shows that the Apostle was not ignorant of such writings, nor did he reject them outright. – Origen’s Commentary on Matthew, Book 13, Section 27

In other words, eight verses before the Apostle Paul claims that all scripture is divinely inspired and useful to train in righteousness, Paul quotes a portion of an apocryphal text to teach and train in righteousness! Based on his own words, it is reasonable to postulate that the apostle Paul believed the Apocryphon of Jannes and Jambres was an acceptable source from which to “train in righteousness”. If the apostle Paul did not believe the book was inspired, it seems exceedingly odd that he would not clarify this point. As a result, it would be reasonable to conclude that the apostle Paul included the Apocryphon of Jannes and Jambres in his acceptable list of inspired scriptures. Another problem with this entire thing is that the Apocryphon of Jannes and Jambres has disappeared, so we have absolutely no way of investigating the source of the story Paul was referencing.

Paul’s reference to the Apocryphon of Jannes and Jambres is just one of many examples of New Testament writers sourcing material from extrabiblical texts. The one example that absolutely stumped me was in Jude 1:14–15:

Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about [ungodly people]: “See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”

Jude quotes directly from the Greek translation of the book of Enoch and explicitly says that Enoch was prophesying. Clearly, Jude regarded this source material as at least somewhat inspired, because he used the word “prophesied”. Frustratingly, just like the apostle Paul, Jude does not clarify to his audience to what degree he considered the source text to be inspired.

So, if Paul and other New Testament authors had no qualms about reading and quoting from the apocryphal texts and never gave any kind of clarification about them, why should we avoid them?

At Moody, I spent considerable time pouring over as many apocryphal texts as I could find. And I what I found legitimately terrified me. No wonder so many churches avoid this stuff!

First, the book of Enoch sheds significant light on some of the commonly brushed-aside stories in the early chapters of Genesis. Genesis 6 casually mentions “the sons of God” taking and impregnating human women sometime before the great flood of Noah, resulting in a sort of hybrid race of giants called the Nephilim. Now, I had learned much about Noah and the flood growing up, but I had never heard a legitimate explanation of these “giants”. The book of Enoch provides a bit more context, explaining that one reason for God’s sending the flood was because of the corruption and chaos these creatures were wreaking on humankind.

According to Enoch, the proliferation of evil had less to do with human wickedness and depravity, as is implied in the extremely brief mention in Genesis, and more to do with the introduction of powerful technology by these “sons of God” and their hybrid beings. According to Enoch, these revealed technologies like smelting metal, sexual seduction through makeup, and prophylactics gave humans the capacity to commit ever greater evil against each other and God. Consequently, God sent the great flood to wipe the slate clean. In the process, the Nephilim hybrids were killed, and their spirits were cursed to walk the earth in a half-dead state.  The rebellious angels that started the chaos by breeding with human women were thrown into a place called Tartarus and chained up until a future date.

I cannot adequately explain the horror I felt when first reading this passage. I had no way to interpret the book of Enoch without having my entire faith thrown into chaos, and I could not unsee what I had seen. Ironically, the New Testament suddenly made more sense to me. For example, the strange use of the word Tartarus in 2 Peter 2:4—the only place in the entire Bible where this Greek word is used—now had a point of origin. Why did Peter not choose another word for hell? Because, according to Jewish literature, Tartarus was the specific place where the rebellious spirits of Genesis 6 were sent!

Growing up, I had been taught a binary view of the spiritual realm. There were angels (good guys), demons (fallen angels), and there was heaven and there was hell. People who accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior go to heaven, where they get to glorify God for all eternity in the presence of angels. Everyone else goes to hell, where they will eventually be joined by Satan and all the fallen angels at the end of time.

But now the story seemed much more complex. Not only did the book of Enoch posit the existence of a class of undead Nephilim roaming the earth—many New Testament authors were confirming it!

When I questioned some of my teachers at Moody Bible about these scriptural oddities, their responses were baffling. Every single person appeared to be uncomfortable, but not so much by the texts themselves but by my noticing them. I was like the software engineer pointing out bugs in our own product and the sales team was getting nervous, not because the software had bugs but because I was going to ruin their marketing campaign. I was directing their attention to biblical texts, texts they taught as divinely inspired, and rather than accepting them for what they are, some people turned on me.

I felt utterly betrayed and began to think that most Christians were absolute hypocrites who ignored their own Bible. I could not see how I could be a humble Christ follower who loves the truth while simultaneously ignoring what I was seeing with my own eyes.

## Chapter 19 – Invalid Prophecies

Famous apologists like Josh McDowell or Lee Strobel often focus on fulfilled prophecies as evidence for Christianity. If a person is given a message from a heavenly visitor about the future and the message comes true, then this is held up as evidence that at least part of the Christian claims must be true.

Before beginning this chapter, it will be important to remind readers who are unfamiliar that in most of Christian tradition the Bible is declared to be the “Word of God” and without any error. We have already touched on some ways in which the Bible does contain errors; however, we will now combine this issue with the issue of problems with Biblical prophecies and prophecy in general. The inerrancy or infallibility of the Biblical canon is thoroughly hammered on in most Protestant doctrinal statements, Bible schools, and theological seminaries. The claim is that the sixty-six books of the modern Protestant Bible is perfect and the final authority in all matters of faith. However, because many of the ancient writings differ in small ways, most fundamentalist Biblical scholars add a qualifier. They posit that the original autographs (the very first written copies) are the only scriptures without any error.

To avoid wild misinterpretations of the text, Bible schools teach hermeneutics.  Hermeneutics is the collection of guiding principles that help a reader interpret scriptural passages. The principles are generic and can be used for interpretation of any text. One of the first things you learn is that “context is king”. To understand what someone meant when they wrote something a long time ago, you must understand the cultural context, the context within the book, and the context within the individual passage or else you might conclude something that is false. Given the preceding claim that the Bible is the Word of God and is our ultimate guide for how we should live our life, a small misinterpretation could lead a person to make a life decision that displeases God. Therefore, understanding context is paramount when interpreting what any passage in the Bible says.

To most young people who grew up within a church environment, these two claims at first seem coherent. However, when students start deeply studying the Bible, they eventually realize that the authors of the New Testament seem to be interpreting the Old Testament with very few guiding rules. In fact, in the entire text of the Bible we do not find any rules on how to interpret the text. Nearly every hermeneutical rule taught in Bible schools were formalized in the last hundred years. The New Testament authors would fail most first-year hermeneutics classes at Bible schools. Let me show some examples I noticed, some of which I started noticing even before I attended Moody.

Back when I was teaching college Bible studies I taught through Hebrews. Hebrews begins by repeatedly quoting Old Testament passages assuming they are referring to the Messiah. In Hebrews 1:6 we run into our first problematic reference:

And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all God’s angels worship him” (Hebrews 1:6, NIV)

If you search your Old Testament for the phrase “Let all God’s angels worship him”, you will come up empty handed. In fact, if you search our most trusted Hebrew Old Testament called the Masoretic Text, this phrase does not exist. However, the phrase does appear in the Greek version of the Old Testament called the Septuagint . Supposedly the Septuagint was perfectly translated from the Hebrew. Why does it differ, then? Naturally, this calls into question either the accuracy of our most trusted Hebrew source or the accuracy of the Septuagint. If the author of Hebrews believed a phrase was inspired that did not exist in the Hebrew version of the Old Testament, is the author implying that a prophetic passage about Jesus was inspired to be changed in the Greek version? If we accept this passage was removed from the Hebrew text at some point, then maybe other texts were changed even before the Septuagint was translated! It should be clear to the reader that this presents a host of challenging problems with inerrancy and of the inspiration of the original autographs. This is just one of hundreds of examples where we cannot know for certain what the original text says. And if we cannot know what the original text says, what is the point of saying it is infallible other than to invent a new religious claim to keep people believing?

Even if we assume that the original Hebrew does have that phrase, the Hebrew author treats this passage as prophetically speaking about the Messiah but the text he is quoting does not mention the messiah at all!  Scholars believe the author of Hebrews is quoting from the Song of Moses in Deuteronomy 32:43 because it is a word-for-word identical to that passage in the Septuagint. Given the widespread memorization of the Septuagint in first century Israel, the Hebrew audience would have understood this. Now, go read Deuteronomy 32. There is not a single reference to the Messiah in the entire passage. To “see” the Messiah in Deuteronomy 32, you have to interpret it quite liberally. How in the world does the author of Hebrews pluck a tiny little phrase from Deuteronomy 32:43 and magically declare that it is about the Messiah? If a modern student were to use this same relaxed style of interpretation, they would fail a first-year Bible school hermeneutics class!

There are numerous other passages that do this, and I will leave this as an exercise to the reader. Simply go through a book, like the gospel of Matthew, and take each quote of the Old Testament and go look up the Old Testament passage. Read the entire Old Testament surrounding context and see if what Matthew is claiming makes sense.

I had been raised to believe that God is perfect and that the Word of God is perfect. However, I now saw that the claim that there are hundreds of Old Testament prophecies about Jesus that were “fulfilled” in some way was questionable. It appeared to me that New Testament authors were extremely loose in their interpretation of the Old Testament and the standard by which a prophecy is “fulfilled” is very low.

But this leads us to a general problem with both prayer and prophecy. The more probable a prophecy or prayer is, the easier it is to fulfill. And the easier a prophecy is to fulfill, the less impressive its fulfillment. If I am in Seattle, and I predict that tomorrow it will rain, nobody will be impressed if it does rain. But imagine I am in the middle of the Chihuahuan desert without a cloud in the sky and I “prophecy” that it will rain an entire foot of water in the next hour. That would be impressive.

So then, the fulfillment of a prayer or prophecy is only impressive if it is both extremely specific and extremely improbable. Unfortunately, as I began to read through the Bible, I repeatedly saw that one prophecy after another were either vague, taken out of context by the New Testament authors, or were just straight up not fulfilled at all (like the new temple in Ezekiel) or only half-fulfilled (like the prophecies about the Messiah conquering his enemies). After considerable study, I concluded that it looked like the early Christian church was trying to smash the square pegs of Old Testament prophecies into the round hole of reality. There were a few prophecies about Jesus that seemed like they might be reasonable (like Daniel 9 or Isaiah 53), but overall, I was not impressed.

# Chapter 20 – Grasping at Straws

By the end of my semester at Moody, I knew the foundational Christian claims were almost assuredly not based in fact. Day after day, my questioning of Christian beliefs among my friends, professors, pastors, and online forums grew bolder. Most Christians I spoke to would regurgitate what they had heard growing up or learned in classes, which were trivial compared to the things I had been studying. Every canned response to an earnest question further convinced me that I—and other skeptics like me—were sadly heading in the right direction. I was heartbroken.

I was truly hoping that someone among my friend group could convince me to stay in Christianity. But to do so they would first need to understand the problems I was discovering. And every time one of them showed a glimmer of understanding, they would get scared and shut down. The possibility of their beliefs being wrong was just too emotionally uncomfortable.  It appeared to me that they did not care about the truth, they cared about looking good and not being rejected by their social group. Quite frankly, I would have been happy to have just one friend genuinely acknowledge even one of the problems I was wrestling with. Or, at the very least, to encounter at least one Christian who said, “Oh Josh, I know exactly what you are talking about, and here is how I resolved that issue.” Instead, my mental inbox of unsolved problems grew daily, and not a single person seemed willing or able to join me in tackling one of them with pure, unbiased honesty. Instead, they all seemed to avoid the problems because they threatened to upend their life choices.

This conundrum led to me wonder why people join Christianity in the first place. When people want to buy a house or make an important financial decision, they are advised to do their research. Wise people caution them to be discerning and not to be influenced by the salesperson’s tactics of fearmongering or love-bombing. They recommend deferring a decision until the situation has been thoroughly investigated and the decision-maker is in a rational and unemotional place. In every area of life, we are advised to make important decisions only after we have gathered and considered all the valid data. Never to sign a contract until we have read the fine print!

However, this wise approach is often abandoned when it comes to faith. Nearly every Christian I knew had made the decision to follow Christ before having gathered all the data, often as an impressionable young child. Most people decide to become a Christian before having even read the Bible. Frustratingly, I remember learning of scholars in Christianity who intentionally avoid teaching deeper theological topics to students until graduate school for fear of scaring them from the faith.

Shockingly, I even discovered a website created by and for pastors, professors, and professionals within the Christian community who were leaving the faith. They could anonymously post about their conversion away from Christianity without fear of losing their positions. Many of them continue to act out the role of a Christian leader while secretly living a double life so they can keep their jobs. The brazen dishonesty of this appalled me!

Near the end of that first semester on Moody campus, I had a discussion with one of the professors. I told him that I was not sure I could continue attending Moody because all students are required to sign a document affirming their belief in a list of Christian doctrines, including biblical inerrancy—the idea that the Bible contains no errors. Because I no longer believed in biblical inerrancy, I told him, it would be a lie for me to sign that document.

His response floored me. He said that many of the professors do not agree with parts of the doctrinal statement but sign it anyway. When I asked how they could justify continuing to teach at the school, he explained that the doctrinal statement was partially dictated by the school’s wealthy donors, many of whom threatened to stop funding the school if certain parts of the doctrinal statement were changed. Naturally, the administration, not wanting to risk losing these donors, kept the doctrinal statement as it was. Professors, despite disagreeing with parts of the doctrinal statement, would just sign it and refrain from challenging those points at the school or in class. But why would the professors sign a document they did not agree with? Well, they needed a job, and there are not a lot of places hiring experts in topics like Biblical Greek and Hebrew.

This latest revelation made me angry. I had left a good-paying career in computer science to follow what I believed was a godly calling. And within the first semester, I had learned that many of the most educated people at the school did not even agree with the documents we students were forced to sign to attend. What is the point of attending a school—where hopefully the primary objective is to learn—if you must agree with the conclusions before you even start learning anything?

As you can imagine, by summer of 2007, I was already basically an atheist.

My journey away from Christianity coincided with the beginning of the New Atheism movement. In 2006, two seminal atheist books were published: Sam Harris’s Letter to a Christian Nation and Richard Dawkins’s The God Delusion. These two books had a massive impact on kickstarting the New Atheist movement in the United States, which I was quickly joining. Among others who joined in on the New Atheism train were people like Bart Ehrman and Dan Barker. Ehrman was a former Moody Bible Institute student who had ascended through the upper educational echelons of church history and biblical languages, only to pop out the other side as an agnostic. In 2005, his book Misquoting Jesus was released, and I found myself agreeing with everything he pointed out. Dan Barker had taken a similar path from Christian ministry to atheism and founded the Freedom from Religion Foundation. Were they, and others like them, the new Martin Luthers, challenging the racket of the Protestant elites?

Growing up, I had been taught that atheism leads to atrocious evils. Godless nations like the Soviet Union, Cuba, and other collapsed Marxist countries were built on a foundation of atheism and their fruit was massive depression and widespread starvation, torture, and death. Remember that my family were subscribers to the Voice of the Martyrs, so I was quite familiar with the atrocities that people might commit if they believed that no gods were going to hold them accountable. But listening to men and women in the New Atheist movement challenged this entire narrative. These were educated people who were not sacrificing babies or trying to establish a one-world communist dictatorship. In fact, most of them opposed all forms of tyranny and expressed admiration for the United States and capitalism. And many of them seemed quite happy!

Christianity now felt worse than wrong; it felt like a cult. It seemed to me a dying religion that relies upon lies, suppression of information, breeding its own converts, and sheltering its children from truth just to stay alive.

# Chapter 21 – Embracing Atheism

As the days ticked by and I immersed myself deeper into the arguments and evidence against Christianity, the final residue of my Christian faith dissipated. My grief at Christianity being false gave way to some form of new hope. I started to see that maybe the world could be beautiful without any vestige of religious belief. There was no reason to fear death because there was no good reason to believe in the existence of a hell. There was no reason to miss Jesus because Jesus was just a real man turned legend, like King Arthur or Robin Hood. Maybe the original Jesus did exist, and perhaps He did teach those wonderful things found in the gospels like loving your enemy, but his followers fell into a common human trapping of turning their cult leader into a miracle worker. Like with all cults, I knew it was pointless to believe in something just because it felt good. By summer of 2007, I accepted that I was an atheist.

Almost as soon as I had determined I no longer believed in God or angels or aliens or anything paranormal, I had a concerning thought. Maybe it was provoked by all the study I had done about people’s paranormal stories and UFO encounters. Or maybe it was Providence. Regardless of its source, the ensuing line of thinking started with a hunch that perhaps spiritual beings occasionally interact with humanity but, for reasons known only to them, keep themselves hidden. Maybe the mystery and obscurity in revelation from our overlords is an essential part of the truth. Would it be worth risking something as awful as hell just because I had been operating from bad data? Maybe I missed something?

Taking into consideration everything I had studied and learned, I decided to formulate one last prayer. Pacing my tiny studio apartment in downtown Chicago, I prayed to the empty room something like this (paraphrased):

God, angels, or aliens—whatever is out there. I do not believe there is any evidence for your existence. However, I realize there might be good reasons for not revealing yourself to us the way we expect. So, I am going to become an atheist. However, if you do exist, I want to give you a chance to prove yourself to me. If you give me a verifiable supernatural experience, I will believe.

[1] I need an experience that happens more than once so that it cannot be written off as some fluky one-off thing.
[2] I need an experience that involves a witness so that I know it was not just in my own head.
[3] I need an experience for which I cannot find a single natural explanation so that the only explanation is that something supernatural happened.

With this last “cover-my-butt” prayer, I was an atheist.

Around this time, I began several friendships with other people who had left Christianity or were considering leaving. Some of them I had met on Facebook and others on Reddit. At the time, the word deconversion was gaining popularity, and online platforms like YouTube were being flooded with content by people who were trying to figure out their life beyond religion. There were hundreds of online communities for people working through their deconversion, and now I was hoping to form genuine friendships with people I had merely been trying to understand before.

Many worried about the drama leaving the faith might cause. Some were severely persecuted by their family and friends. Others managed to leave without too much trouble. Still others had decided to just fake being Christian around certain family members or to slowly stop attending church over time because openly admitting their apostasy would be too contentious.

I spent a lot of time reading forum comments on the undercover network of church leaders who were clandestine atheists. Under the cover of anonymity, they could admit their continuing to preach or lead music or engage in ministry even though they secretly no longer believed. Many of them had memorized the standard Christianese lines, tropes, and doctrines so well they could say them in their sleep. It required little effort for them to keep up the charade. These people were from every Christian denomination, and many of them had left the faith many years before. The support forum was filled with people discussing how to deal with family members and how to cope with living a double life.

Since I was a little child, I have always been a brazenly honest person. Over time, I have discovered that one of the benefits of never lying is that, even if people get upset at you for telling the truth, they still respect you. And telling the truth to your own detriment increases respect the most. Being blatantly honest about your failures and doubts builds trust with good people. So, while I briefly considered a silent exit from Christianity, I knew it was dishonest and would lead to a loss of respect. Consequently, I needed to announce my conversion to atheism and online seemed the best place to do it. 

At the time, I had roughly four hundred Facebook friends—and almost all of them were conservative Christians. As scary as it seemed, I knew that posting an announcement on Facebook would be the most efficient way to rip off the proverbial Band-Aid and get all the pain over with at once. So, one day, with my heart beating rapidly in my chest, I switched my Facebook profile status from Christian to Atheist. The response was swift and intense.

Private messages and public comments flooded my account. Many of them were extremely long, and I became adept at writing detailed logical replies. The flood was both intellectually invigorating and emotionally depressing. It was invigorating because I was getting a lot of attention that reaffirmed my decision. But it was emotionally depressing because of the poor treatment I was receiving from so many of my so-called friends! They did not seem to care at all about my arguments, and it was arguments that had turned me to atheism! Only a couple of friends were willing to engage in intellectual debate, and not one Christian was willing to acknowledge and honestly address the problems I was seeing with the faith. Instead, ignoring the arguments, most Christians tried to find alternative secret reasons I left the faith.

Some suggested I might have—or even outright accused me of having—some secret and hidden sin. This suggestion bothered me on one level because they were completely ignoring my stated reasons for leaving the faith. But what really hurt was the assumed implication—or accusation—that I must be lying or hiding a secret.

Other Christians wondered if there was a hidden emotional reason for my leaving the faith, hinting that I might have been abused and that was the real reason I left. I was so insulted by people’s assumptions that I could not, as a grown adult, make my own decisions or think for myself. So many people needed me to be either a victim or a liar to prop up their bias. My anger grew as these “Christians “insisted that I must not be telling the entire story as to why I was leaving the faith.

Several Christians attacked me for not trying hard enough or for giving up too soon. Now, to be fair, a few Christians were not like this. One of them was my cousin Joseph. He certainly did not agree with me, but he conceded that I had always been so honest and studied so diligently that he could respect my decision. This meant a lot to me. A few of my Moody friends saw the state I was in and reached out to check on me. They did not try to debate me, and I could see they were still trying to be friends to some extent. Additionally, I received tremendous support from two of my best Christian friends, Steve and Deb Friesen.

Nearly twenty years later, I can still feel pain as I recollect on many of these responses.

The year following this announcement might be the most painful of my life, as one after another of my Christian friends railed at me. Within a year, I was convinced that most devoted Christians were like white blood cells desperately defending their little community from any perceived threats. A totally natural response. Not a hint of the supernatural. Where was God in this? All I saw was human anger, resentment, and psychological biases.

I was barely twenty-three years old, and I was losing everyone I ever knew because—as I perceived it—I chose to be honest. Before my decision, I had hundreds of friends, a good reputation, and a supportive community. But now I could feel it all crashing. It felt like most people were exhibiting a conditional love: we will love you if you agree with our beliefs.

Eventually, overwhelmed by angry messages, fruitless debates, and endless attacks, I deleted my Facebook account and created a new one. In a way, it was symbolic of the old life I was leaving behind and the new one I was starting from scratch.

# Chapter 22 – Vanishing Demons

At this time, I was adjusting to living in my tiny studio apartment on Dearborn Street in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago. Each night my living room became my bedroom, my couch converting to my bed—a wild contrast to the spacious houses and yards of Wichita. From my window, I could just make out a sliver of Lake Michigan’s frigid waters beyond the famous Lake Shore Drive highway. Every Friday and Saturday night, I heard the raucous sounds of men and women getting drunk and reveling and roaming the street below. I was sick with jealousy and longing that I was missing out on this carefree life. This hedonistic world was open to me, but I had no idea how to participate.

One night, I had a spiritually themed dream that would prove prophetic many years later. In my dream, I lay paralyzed on my couch, while a demonic being slowly entered me, starting from the tips of my toes and inching its way through every cell of my body, consuming my being. It crept first through my lower legs, then my groin, then my torso, and finally into my arms. At my throat, I felt it moving up toward my brain, and in terror, I inhaled to scream. As I did, I jolted upright in bed, wide awake. I distinctly remember the sun shining in through my window, casting beautiful shadows on my decor and the old wood-panel floor.

“Oh, thank God that was just a dream,” I nearly said out loud.

As I shook off the horrid feeling the dream had left me with, I reflected on the awfulness of Christianity. If I had not been raised with all that nonsense about demons and hell, I probably would have never had that dream! Religion truly does brainwash us, I thought, and I felt an urgency to help others recover from the trauma that religious beliefs can inflict on our impressionable minds. I wanted to protect every child from ever hearing about the lies of hell so that they would never experience all the things that I did. And I began to make it a personal mission to rid my mind of every vestige of religious thought—to be a free soul, unburdened by the mythical and mystical beliefs of our ancestors.

And with that dream, all spiritual experiences ceased.

During the New Atheism movement, so many stories were about people who, like me, were struggling psychologically with how to recover from religious brainwashing. I made numerous friends in these online communities and even met many of them in person. Some of their stories I will never forget. Two common themes emerged from all the deconversion stories I heard and read. The first was deep inquiry and investigation into religious doctrine and a desire to construct a new mental framework on the other side of deconversion. The second was feelings of anger and betrayal at the hypocrisy of church leaders. I came across far too many sad stories of both men and women who had been deceived and seduced and even raped by Christian pastors or youth leaders, only to see the church cover it up. In many anonymous posts, churchgoers lamented not being able to speak their doubts publicly for fear of what they might lose.

Making secular friends in person was difficult at first. All my life, new friends tended to be handed to me through church activities. In religious circles, there is a sense of safety knowing that another person believes the same things you do. The idea that I could just go make friends with potentially anyone was baffling. How would I know who the trustworthy friends were if there were no religious test I could apply?

At my new programming job, I would laugh and joke with coworkers, but I was oblivious to their pop-culture references. The number of pop-culture references most Americans mix into their everyday conversations is truly amazing. I knew nothing about secular music, had barely seen any movies, and had not read so many of the books that were popular when people my age were children, like the Harry Potter series. Compared to the average person at work, I felt like I had grown up Amish.

As a result of this discovery, and with the help of others, I developed some social habits that proved quite effective at ingratiating myself with non-Christians. In awkward social situations, I would simply tell people that I grew up homeschooled and used to be a Christian. This admission almost always set the perfect tone for making friends, as it helped everyone make sense of my social faux pas. To my surprise, my story would often pique people’s interest. Many would give me a pat on the back, buy me a beer, and let me vent about my upbringing. My new friends would ask questions about Christianity, and I would not hesitate to fill them in on why I left, explaining various absurdities in the Bible I had discovered or odd Christian behaviors I had witnessed. The story of the guy who had prophesied his dog would rise from the dead was one of my most salient examples of the insanity of believing in God.

These recurring conversations helped me build some fantastic friendships. We would bond over beers and laughter up and down the bars, pubs, and restaurants of downtown Chicago and Wicker Park. I would pepper people with questions about their secular lives—the things they loved to do, how they felt about politics or business, and anything else that I felt had been hidden from me in my sheltered Christian upbringing. I was surprised to discover that secular, heathen people are generally very kind!

After leaving Christianity my pornography consumption increased significantly, to the point I was watching pornography daily. I justified it by reasoning that I just needed to overcome the shame caused by years of repressed sexual urges and guilt over my lustful desires. Purity was just a construct invented by religious people, I told myself, and so I had to undo the damage that this teaching had done to my psyche.

Despite my crippling confusion about sexual relationships and my ignorance about how to even start one, I found myself with a girlfriend shortly after leaving Moody. Anita contacted me on Facebook, and one thing led to another. Growing up, I had been repeatedly taught that the only way to have a good sexual relationship was to have a godly, biblical relationship. Despite now being an atheist, I imagined that I would be able to follow many of the same principles I had learned about courtship. My goal was to date this girl, build a solid relational foundation, and show my family that an atheist could have a good relationship.

Due to the entire homeschool community’s commitment to hiding sexual information, I had never received an education about hormones or physical attraction or the mechanics of sex. Because of my sheltered upbringing, almost everything of what I knew about sex came from watching pornography. And most of what I knew about relationships was the courtship model. I was beyond confused.

Additionally, I kept reading online and hearing from secular friends that you should not settle for your first girlfriend but should, instead, get out and “sow your wild oats.” While Anita and I shared an intellectual life, our romantic relationship felt predictably mechanical. My pornography addiction was not helping. To add to the stack of problems, I was still sorting through the emotional trauma resulting from the strife in my family and at the church back home.

I was an emotional mess. I would vacillate from the elation of having a girlfriend to horror at the thought I might be settling to anxiety that maybe she was cheating. Ultimately, I ended that relationship by being mean and deeply immature, for which I am still deeply sorry. 

One day I was discussing women with a friend, and I disclosed my uncertainty about how to approach them. He boasted that he was regularly getting dates and sleeping with women. He told me that what he had learned was like taking the red pill in the Matrix—if he revealed to me the truth, I might not be able to go back. This had me curious. That day I was introduced to the schemes of the pickup artist.

This friend recommended I read Neil Strauss’s The Game, a book full of methods for attracting women, whether for long-term relationships or one-night stands. I was generally disgusted by the pickup artist’s bag, but Strauss’s approach was less about sleaze and more about increasing your overall attractiveness. My long-term goal was to find someone I could marry and have a family with. However, the idea of being able to sleep with a lot of women in my twenties, before settling down, was a tantalizing carrot. If I happened to find the right woman in the process, that would be great, but in the meantime, I figured I should have fun sleeping around!

The Game was eye-opening. Strauss’s methods for finding a girlfriend were effective, even if they do involve questionable seductive practices. In the book, he summarizes a set of principles for attracting women. The goal, according to Strauss, is to learn the psychology of what attracts women and to be that. Strauss shares story after story of men using these methods to sleep with multiple women a week—sometimes multiple women a night. As a physically healthy, pornography-addicted twenty-three-year-old man, this sounded perfect.

So I began to practice, flirting up multiple women at a time in the hopes of coaxing at least one of them on a date or to a bed. One of Strauss’s principles—which I now find incredibly sad—is to prevent yourself from getting too emotionally invested in any one woman until you know which one you want. For this to work, sex and emotions must be kept as separate as possible. And you must be willing to practice certain tricks, like ignoring the girl you want to sleep with while focusing entirely on her friend to make the other woman jealous for your attention. It is all manipulation.

Within several years, I was selfishly counting the number of women I had slept with. With the sexual revolution in full swing, aided by apps like Tinder, we all reassured ourselves that our actions would not have consequences. Many women also spoke openly about their flings with me, even notching their “conquests” in bedposts. It might be worth noting at this point that none of us were ever emotionally satisfied or at peace, we were just constantly chasing a new high which meant throwing away your previous high – a person.

Inspired by the techy friends I had surrounded myself with, my motto for nearly ten years was “work hard, party hard.” We would regularly drink on weeknights and show up to work the next day pounding vitamins, electrolytes, ibuprofen, and water. You might expect this to be the start of a quick descent into alcoholism or abusing drugs or losing my job or having a run-in with the law, but either I was just smart enough about how I partied or I was being protected by someone above—or both.

Despite the warnings I had received as a kid about the harms of living this kind of lifestyle, the friends I hung out with seemed to be good about looking out for each other. A few times, I helped support friends who had gotten drunk to the point of vomiting. On other occasions, I was tucked into bed by these same friends. When anyone was going through a breakup or dealing with something difficult, we would all check on that person. The care that I observed and received from these nonbelievers reassured me that many of my parents’ fears about “the world” were hogwash.

Although my escapades often involved heavy drinking, I was not addicted to alcohol. But I certainly was addicted to sex. No amount would fully satisfy, even if the woman was willing to do some edgy things. I would be lying if I said it was not fun—it absolutely was. But for each ounce of fun, there was double the emotional pain, which I then drowned in more alcohol. Hangovers, heartbreak, the grief of rejection, and the guilt of rejecting were just a few of the consequences of this lifestyle. 

My relationship with my parents during this time was quite complicated. I loved them to death, but it was so hard to connect. I eventually gave up trying to converse about serious topics, as it usually made me raging mad. Instead, I opted for the passive-aggressive route, inserting my views into conversations in ways that could not easily be refuted. My modus operandi was to make my parents feel guilty for forcing me to go to church and indoctrinating me with their beliefs for all those years.

You see, while I was out living up my atheist life, I was still getting messages from people inside my parents’ church, where Pastor Joe had established his domain. On one occasion, I received an email from an anonymous person who was attending my parents’ church despite leaving the faith. He said that, after seeing the way everyone there had treated and talked about me after my deconversion, he was so scared to admit he agreed with me that he was pretending to be a Christian just to avoid abuse.

Have you ever had a reverse nightmare, in which you wake up from a good dream to the horror of real life? During this time, I was having recurring dreams that my frayed relationships with my family were restored through mutual forgiveness and compassion, only to awake to the reality around me. In these dreams, warm feelings of home would wash over me, and I was open and ready to forgive everything. Upon waking, I realized the familial happiness was just a fantasy. Something inside me was dying and I felt there was absolutely nothing to do to fix it except keep pushing forward.

# Chapter 23 – Church through an Atheist Lens

Around 2009, despite all the family tension, I was elated to hear that my brother was getting married, even though he and his then fiancée had asked Pastor Joe to perform the ceremony. My brother kindly asked me to be in the wedding party, and I accepted. As best I could tell, my family had determined I was never a real Christian, so they just treated me like I had always been an atheist.

I was still living in Chicago at the time. On the trek back to Wichita, I felt sick to my stomach, uncertain of how I would feel standing on stage and watching my brother get married by a man who had treated me and numerous others so poorly.

I arrived a few days before the wedding, which gave me time to have dinner with Steve and Deb Friesen at their home. If you remember, Steve and Deb were not surprised at my conversion to atheism and were not argumentative or judgmental toward me in the least. Pastor Joe had ousted them from Beth-Eden, and I hoped I could lend support and learn what had been going on.

Like myself, the Friesens had grown wary of Pastor Joe’s tyrannical tendencies. Steve, who served as an elder at Beth-Eden, had received concerns from congregants that Pastor Joe was a controlling leader who treated any pushback as insubordination. Even more alarming were the accusations that he was emotionally abusing his wife and kids. In one poignant story, one of Pastor Joe’s young daughters asked during Sunday School prayer requests for prayer that mommy would stop crying whenever daddy came home.

For years, I had doubted myself for my run-in with Pastor Joe at that Starbucks. Now I saw that the treatment I received was normal Pastor Joe behavior. I was so disappointed and furious with the church’s so-called leadership. In fact, Steve made it clear that the other elders were aware of various allegations against Pastor Joe but had dismissed them because, in their words, there were “not enough witnesses.”

As tension grew and Joe’s chaotic behavior heightened, the Friesens dug into Pastor Joe’s past, in particular what had happened at his previous church. Apparently, Pastor Joe had caused such a schism at his former church that, for all practical purposes, the church was nothing more than an empty building. The former church had hired Pastor Joe largely on his credentials, but once hired, Joe tried to insert his will into every aspect of the church. The leadership tried to gently reign him in, but met with his stubborn resistance, they felt compelled to kick him out. When Joe rebelled, half the church was firmly on his side. The split within the church was so severe that the congregation essentially disbanded.

Pacing the Friesen’s living room, I tried to process what I was hearing: my family’s small church was exhibiting signs of a cult run by a sociopath. We spent hours talking, and I questioned how the kind Christian people I had grown up with could become so cultlike.

I also learned from the Friesens that night that Joe had instructed church members on how to deal with me when I declared my atheism. His instructions essentially boiled down to this: “Josh was never a real Christian, so we will have no more discussions with him about anything.” For the longest time, I wondered why my dad and brother appeared to ignore me on tons of topics, and now I partially knew why. This was just the normal way of dealing with the people who did not fall into line.

Naturally, when Pastor Joe started to sense that Steve was catching on to his controlling behavior, he began sabotaging Steve and his family. As part of his counterattack, Joe enlisted a couple of my friends to spy on Steve. The word spy might seem an exaggeration, but one of my former friends used this exact word to explain the tasks he had been given to do. Joe instructed them to attend Bible studies or teaching led by Steve, in hopes of catching him in heretical teachings. The goal was clear, to trap Steve in some dirt to get rid of him.

After several months of this espionage, the Friesens were kicked out of the church on trumped up theological charges. If I recall correctly, they had to do with a minor disagreement on a theological point that Joe hammered as essential. Steve was forced to write a resignation letter, but Joe disapproved of the tone of the letter because it implied that Steve had done nothing wrong. Steve refused to revise it because he had written the truth. Someone else modified Steve’s resignation letter to make it look as if the Friesens were confessing to bad behavior, and it was read publicly in front of the church. By pure manipulation, Joe won. And this man was now marrying my brother and I was being asked to stand on stage with him. I was an emotional wreck.

After my evening with the Friesens, I was faced with two gut-wrenching decisions: whether I should attend my brother’s wedding and whether I should say something to him. Given what I had just heard and the ensuing knot in my stomach, I detested the thought of just standing happily on the wedding stage. My only option was to bring this all before my brother.

After some brief niceties, I explained to my brother the gist of what I had heard from Steve Friesen: the accusations of Joe’s bullying behavior, the power plays, the spies, and so on. I fully expected my brother to show at least some concern. To my shock, he acted incredibly annoyed, alleging that the real problem was Steve. He defended Pastor Joe and insisted that nobody could corroborate these accusations. He criticized my terrible timing and confirmed that Pastor Joe would be officiating his wedding on Saturday no matter what. He then pressed me as to whether I would be attending the wedding or not.

Floored, I did not know what to do. Why was it that all of my “Christian” friends seemingly did not care about the truth, just living a comfortable life? If I recall correctly, I told him that I needed to sleep on it. The next day, I decided I would join the wedding anyway.

I can remember the rehearsal and wedding quite well and it stirs up very painful memories. Externally, I was smiling, but my internal experience of that wedding was horrible. I tried my best to ignore for a short time what I had heard. I stood up there next to that man while he married my brother and his wife. My emotions were being whipped up in a blender set on high—rage, disbelief, self-doubt, love, excitement, fear, you name it. But, like I did during my teens, I just suppressed everything because I had exhausted every avenue I knew to make a difference. The only emotions I did not feel that day were peace, security, and a sense of home.

With these learnings, I reassured myself I had made the right decision to become an open and vocal atheist. There was no way on this earth that my conscience would allow me to participate in this type of system, but my decision was going to cost me so much.

# Chapter 24 – Failure to Compromise

As I moved into my thirties, I learned to temper the anger I felt toward my family and church in general, but it was beyond difficult. I would often be triggered by a comment or even the sight of something at a church to the point of needing a hot shower or several drinks and cigarettes to calm myself. A therapist I was seeing during this time diagnosed me with PTSD and generalized anxiety directly connected with everything I had experienced.

I tried to redirect my youthful energy into educating myself, forming new friendships, building my career as a software engineer, and chasing women. My hope was to establish myself as a solid, intellectual atheist, meet and marry a wonderful secular woman, and prove to my family that happiness was achievable outside their cult. I envisioned myself as a potential trailblazer for my family.

Philosophically, I strove to align my internal model of the world with my external reality. My working theory was that intellectual anxiety surfaces when our internal belief system does not properly correspond with our daily experiences. The closer we organize our life and beliefs to reality, the more peace we will have. Or so I thought.

To some extent, this theory did work. And as time progressed, I became quite comfortable with partying, dating, sleeping around, traveling, and going to shows. Not being encumbered by any religious rituals freed up a lot of time, and not feeling any guilt about my desires for attention, fun, and sex helped to alleviate shame at acting on my urges.

One argument I repeatedly heard as a child was that a person cannot be moral without a belief in God. But I was convinced that one could set up and abide by a secular moral system. My moral system consisted first of aiming to be as honest as possible and second to do my best to avoid actions that might harm other people or restrict their will. In some sense, I adhered to the Golden Rule. Despite no longer believing the divinity of Jesus, I still felt that one should “do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” I wanted others to be honest with me and to try not to hurt me, so I figured I should do my best to do the same to them. Naturally, people make mistakes, so I was not expecting perfection, but it was the start of a moral framework.

For the first several years as an atheist, I felt an increasing sense of peace and security. I had no fear of death, although I did fear the process of dying. All my spiritual experiences stopped, and I no longer had any experiences of “dark demonic presences” visiting me. Overall, for the first period of atheism I felt that I was genuinely growing closer to a complete escape from the psychological mess that was religion. I was becoming more free and happy, and experiencing so much of the world. The only times that I regressed into depression had to do with interactions with my former Christian friends and acquaintances. As a result, I did my best to distance myself from anything referencing Christianity as it often triggered extremely painful memories. The new form of atheism seemed to provide a sense of peace and security if one had a blend of a good philosophical outlook and the moral system I just described. In some sense, I identified greatly with Buddhism.

However, as years progressed, I became increasingly disturbed that so many of my close secular friends were abandoning any sense of a moral framework. Stories of their lying, cheating, and even stealing began to stack up. For many, there was no concept of right and wrong, only a fear of being caught. Despite my lack of any faith, abortion still deeply bothered me. I could not rightly see how a fetus could be seen as non-human. Naturally, it pained me greatly when I learned of many of my friends having the procedure. The promise of New Atheism had been a movement where morality could be practiced independent of religious beliefs, but I felt quite alone in my efforts. On the surface, people promised love and caring, but when things got tough, people would lie and cheat to come out ahead. And they went on their merry way if nobody held them accountable.

In addition, the playboy lifestyle had promised sexual satisfaction without the emotional hangups, but after many years it began to pummel my emotions. My addiction to pornography, sex, and dating kept me going back for more heartache. Each new relationship or chase was like a drug, and when I did not have some woman flirting with me, internal voices reassured me I was unattractive and worthless. I craved female attention so much that I fell into depression whenever I did not have it. I maintained a constant presence on dating apps, trying to keep multiple women in conversation to reassure myself I was worth something. In the secular world, a person’s worth is often dependent on how much others perceive them to be a sexual conquest. This perspective can only lead to depression as everyone becomes less and less sexually attractive as they get older. Despite my internal growing pain, I reassured myself that I was still in my prime! I had a long time before the true frustration of age hit me. I just needed to stay in shape, focus on my career, and build up a fun and adventurous lifestyle to counter the pain of growing older.

By 2014, I grew discontent with life in Chicago. Like so many other tech nerds at that time, I decided I should move to San Francisco, where my computer science career could flourish. I quit my job, sold most of my stuff, and began the trek toward California. On the way, I stopped in Wichita for a few weeks to visit family and friends. I was in the middle of the interview process with multiple Silicon Valley companies and fully intended on accepting one of them. But as I met with family and old friends and the nostalgia of home grew on me, I saw that maybe a Midwest lifestyle could be more satisfying than the big city grind.

On a whim, I canceled the job applications that were in process in San Francisco and decided to stay in Wichita for the foreseeable future, where I started a software consulting company. Deep down, my main priority was restoring relationships with my immediate family, whom I still loved deeply and had not given up on.

I was quite alone at first in Wichita despite growing up there because most of my friends had moved to other cities. Thankfully, I started making new friends around town and found two roommates. Still, compared to Chicago—and its endless partying and dining in fancy restaurants—Wichita felt like a social desert.

For a time, I joined an atheist group in Wichita, through which I got to meet Matt Dillahunty, who was growing in popularity in the New Atheism movement as a podcaster who would often debate religious people online. This group provided a semblance of community for a while.

I regularly met with my family. With each meeting, I became more and more depressed as I realized that not only did they seem completely uninterested in any conversations about serious matters with me, but it felt like so much had changed it was impossible to connect. We were living in entirely different worlds, and the wounds of the past were repeatedly being reopened. The feeling that no matter what I did my family was never going to understand pushed me to a new breaking point.

At this time, the infamous election tussle between Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump was in full swing, and I was paying attention to politics like a hawk. My atheistic worldview had led me to support abortion (despite my personal reservations, I figured it should be legal), LGBTQ ideas, and progressive doctrines, so I naturally supported the Democratic party. I was particularly drawn to Bernie Sanders due to his unwavering honesty. Bernie regularly touted Sweden as a model for some of the policies he wanted to implement in the United States, which got me quite interested in the Scandinavian region. At the time the World Happiness Report, which has attempted to measure global wellbeing since 2012, had consistently listed Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark near the top of its annual rankings. The statistical study found year after year that Scandinavian people are the happiest in the world despite being heavily atheist. Additionally, their cultures emphasize being fit and healthy, attractive, and providing ready access to great healthcare. To top it off, their lives are not inhibited by religious trappings in any way. Scandinavia seemed like a secular heaven!

As Providence would have it, a Chicago friend and colleague named Sidd was soon to visit some Danish friends in Aarhus, Denmark and asked if I wanted to join. I accepted his invitation without hesitation!

We arrived in Oslo around Christmas time and were dazzled by the lights and festivities. From there, we made our way to Aarhus just in time for the most incredible New Years fireworks celebration I have ever seen. During my time in Norway and Denmark, I was struck by the cleanliness of the streets, the tidy simplicity of the restaurants and bars, and the classiness of the people—all of which appeared on the surface a stark contrast to the dirty streets of many American cities and the brusqueness of American culture.

But it was the final short train ride to Stockholm, Sweden, prior to our return to the States that changed my life forever. Upon arrival, Sidd and I booked an Airbnb hosted by a young couple, Maria and Alex.

Maria, it turns out, was originally from Minneapolis but was in Stockholm dating Alex, a native Swede. Nearly ten years later, Maria and Alex are now married, and the three of us have remained steadfast friends. As a rare Catholic in Sweden, Maria balanced her faith with a progressive mindset. At the time, Alex was the CEO of a small start-up involved in construction software. When Maria discovered I was a software engineer interested in a potential move to Sweden, she urged me to talk to Alex about a job.

I was initially hesitant to commit to moving abroad, and I wanted to wait for the 2016 election results in November before deciding anything. If the political vibes in the United States got worse, then I would move to Sweden. In the meantime, I began doing some contract work with Alex’s small business, and along the way, I made friends with the other employees, all of whom were in their twenties.

On election night, I shared many Americans’ shock and dismay at Donald Trump’s victory. Media reports about Trump’s connections to Russia, the Steele dossier, and Robert Mueller’s investigation had me eagerly anticipating an announcement from the FBI that they had caught Donald Trump in some felonious activity and would lock him away forever. Instead, I felt I had awoken to a dystopian America with a Russian puppet for a president.

Immediately after the presidential victory, I texted Alex to “get me out of here.” He immediately offered me the position of CTO and began the process of helping me get residency as his employee, which was surprisingly smooth.

So began my journey of leaving the United States for the dream of a happy atheist life in Sweden. My hopes were to win big in the tech start-up scene, meet a beautiful atheist woman, and indulge my tendencies for wanderlust by exploring Europe. It was like a dream come true. So many Americans said they would leave the United States if Trump won, but I was one of the few who had an opportunity to do it.

Before I could start this quest, I had to break things off with the girl I was dating, sell my beloved BWM M3 sports car, and, saddest of all, find a new home for my cat Spartacus. But it was all going to be worth it to restart my life completely from scratch in Stockholm. In my rearview mirror would be all my failed attempts to compromise my atheist perspective with American religious culture. Ahead lay a complete reset of my life and the hope of a peaceful and secure secular future.

# Chapter 25 - New Life in Stockholm

My last weekend in Wichita was busy and bittersweet. With help from some family and roommates, I held a garage sale to get rid of as much stuff as I could and pocketed nearly $1,000 in cash. My goal was to fit every remaining physical possession into two checked bags, a carry-on bag, and a backpack. The plan was to drive up to Chicago with my cat Spartacus and my road bicycle and drop them both off at their respective new homes. I would then take a one-way flight to Stockholm, Sweden, where I was excited to meet a potential new girlfriend I had met on Tinder. Also waiting for me were a group of friends at my new place of employment and a couple places to stay for the first month or so while I found a more permanent flat. I envisioned a new life with European parties, a booming tech industry in the Silicon Valley of Europe, and a release from every triggering thing in my past. Sweden would be my promised land.

I was not alone in my goals. Tens of thousands of Americans at that time were considering moving to Sweden, many of them motivated by Bernie Sanders’ championing of the country as a model of democratic socialism. In a twist of Providence, a childhood friend of mine named Jason was among these other adventurous souls. He and his family arrived in Sweden within a couple weeks of me—and we had not planned this at all! Our collective move would later prove to be momentous.

I arrived in late spring, just as the weather was turning perfect. Those first several months in Stockholm were a bit of a honeymoon period. I could not shake the rush of excitement at the novelty of everything. Every sign, every menu, every piece of clothing, all the architecture, and even the technology was just different enough to make even a quick jaunt to the store a magical experience. Europe was gorgeous through my rose-tinted glasses.

By June, I had found my stride. At the famous Swedish midsummer celebration, the sun never goes down and the party never stops. My new friends and girlfriend and I played the Swedish yard game Kubb by the light of the midnight sun, all a little sloshed from our drinking of the traditional schnapps alcohol.

While I loved so much about Sweden - and still miss it - not everything was as rosy as had been promised. It took a little while before the rose-tinted glasses began to fade.

Sweden proved to be not quite as safe as had been promised. My arrival in Sweden was greeted by a murder at my long-stay hotel in the Stockholm suburbs that first month. Apparently, an immigrant of some sort had been stabbed to death in some deal gone wrong in one of the hotel rooms and guards were set up day and night. This was my introduction to some of the mafias that exist in Europe. Before I had come to Sweden, I had been assured by the internet that Sweden was one of the safest places in the country and a murder had occurred not fifty meters from the room I was staying in. It was truly unsettling and the first major sign that perhaps things were not so rosy as I had hoped.

Second, shortly after I arrived, Sweden had its worst terrorist attack in history when another immigrant drove a truck down one of its most prominent streets, killing many pedestrians. I can remember the day this happened, and it shocked all of us to our core as information trickled in about the attack. Sweden was supposed to be safe, what was going on?

Swedish romantic relationships were initially a relief for me, but quickly I became even more confused. There are no cultural taboos about sex before marriage as I had grown up with, and most people treat sex as if it is like taking a jog. At first this sounds fantastic, but it adds new complications. For starters, having multiple partners is almost expected when dating and being jealous is seen as a sign of weakness or that you are not sexually attractive enough to also have multiple partners. I found myself thoroughly confused, wondering at all the unspoken rules about casual relationships and what indicated the switch to a more serious partnership. Bizarrely, people would often date for over 20 years and then finally decide to get married. The romantic intentions and reactions of most people in Europe made no sense to me at all.

Each cultural mistake on my part was a stark reminder that I did not know Swedish or how Swedish culture worked. While Swedes can be exceptionally patient, they are also very particular about a lot of things.  Thankfully in most of my early mistakes, most Swedes would hear my American English accent and were quite gracious in dismissing my faux pas, but each tiring negative interaction did build up over time.

That first year was more difficult than I wanted to admit, and it took a good six months before I had my first heavy experience of culture shock. I reassured myself that the things I was experiencing were just “cultural differences” and that I would get over it in time. But subconsciously, every tiny misunderstanding was sucking me dry. Just receiving a single Swedish letter in the mail could consume a half hour of translating it word by word. How was I supposed to have the energy to learn a new culture and maintain my career and start a family and have fun partying at the same time?

Sweden makes big promises about the fairness of their system of government, but their bureaucracy was utterly stifling. Swedish people implicitly trust government and almost never speak up when something goes wrong. As a result, when one thing is out of place or a mistake occurs there is often mass confusion. Swedes love their queues (lines) and love following written policies even when they do not make sense. If you want something in Sweden, you grab a number or make a phone call and request a place in whatever queue is needed and wait for anywhere from two minutes or two hours or two years. They will eventually get to it. But if there is a mistake anywhere in paperwork or a vagueness in a written law, double that time.

To support fair wages, Swedish culture heavily encourages people to only work as much as their union contract says, which at first sounds great! But because of this you end up with zero sense of urgency for anything. For the first several months, I dealt with a bureaucratic deadlock because the immigration agency could not get me my immigration card until I could prove I had a job with a paycheck, my job could not pay me “properly” because I did not have a bank account to transfer money to, and the bank would not give me an account because I did not have my immigration card! Each person in each department was doing exactly as their written guidance said to do, and nobody had any sense of responsibility to help beyond that. Eventually we sorted it out after several months, but it was a shocking contrast to the organized utopia that had been advertised.

These types of situations happened daily, and by the end of the first year the emotional drain was taking its toll. My new friends in Sweden were super encouraging and regularly invited me to parties to make new friends and were there with listening ears whenever I had trouble, but I was definitely beginning to suspect that democratic socialism and a secular culture was not nearly as rosy as I had hoped.

As winter of my first year approached, the honeymoon phase of my move to Sweden was fading. As daylight got shorter, I could feel seasonal depression taking over me and my doubts grew. I did my best to reassure myself that I was only 31, still fresh and full of energy, and I had a full European life ahead of me! I encouraged myself repeatedly that most of my problems had to do with being raised in a sheltered religious lifestyle and that it was just going to take some more hard work to achieve the perfect life without religion. Sweden, atheism, and a secular life could still work, I just needed to keep pushing forward--alone.

# Chapter 26 - Ghost in London

Around the time I left my first job in Sweden, I met a new friend who I will call Hailey. Hailey was a cute software recruiter with whom I had become connected as CTO of the Swedish start-up I worked at. I met both her and her male friend simultaneously at a tech conference held in the famous Stockholm City Hall. Her friend invited me to come to London to hang out sometime and explore the city, and I agreed. I bought plane tickets and did not book a place to stay because he had promised a couch at his penthouse suite. The weekend I chose to visit was Halloween weekend, October 25 - 31, 2017, one of the most important weekends of my life.

Shortly before this, I had begun the process of applying for a job at Spotify. People touted Spotify as one of the most progressive companies in the world and they were quickly becoming the most popular music service. The idea that I was going to be working at one of the most highly desired software jobs in the world was a dream come true. All my fingers were crossed as I prepared for my official video interview that was to take place Monday, October 30 while I was in London. Deep inside I was hoping this job would be the final ticket to solidifying my new life.

A couple days before my flight, I messaged the friend who promised me a place to stay. Despite having known I was coming, to my shock, he responded and said that he had completely forgotten and was going to be out of town. I had spent money on a round-trip plane ticket and had no way to cancel. Where was I going to stay?

Frustrated, I remember chatting with Maria about the entire situation and asking for advice. She highly encouraged me to still go to London anyway and just turn it into an adventure. After all, in the worst-case scenario I could just get a hotel or a cheap AirBnB at the last minute. Perhaps my friend Hailey could put me up for a night or two?

Thursday afternoon I arrived and immediately messaged Hailey to let her know that I wanted to hang out and that her friend had bailed on me. She gave me an offer to crash at her place that night after meeting up for drinks but said she had a super busy weekend because of Halloween and because she was starting a new business that following Monday and had a lot of work to finish. I scheduled an AirBnb for Friday night.  Hailey let me know that she was going to a Halloween party on Saturday and I was invited to go with her and crash at her place afterwards. At this point, I had a place to sleep Thursday night at Hailey’s and a place to sleep Friday night at an AirBnB and then there was the possibility of crashing at Hailey’s place on Saturday but Sunday and Monday were unscheduled.

Late Friday I arrived at the AirBnB I had booked for one night. Upon arrival, I was greeted at the door by a woman who appeared to be perhaps in her early 50s. She casually informed me that she owned the entire three-story flat and that her children had all moved out. Since she had several empty rooms she decided to make some extra money by renting them out to both long-term and short-term tenants. She just so happened to have the top room free and that was the one that I had booked.

As we toured the home, she introduced me to another one of her short-term tenants, a middle-aged man who was working intently on his laptop in the living room. He took off his headphones to say hi and she informed me that this was Rodney and he was working on some important editing for a video that was to be presented before the United Nations and Donald and Melania Trump near the end of the year. Rodney informs me the video was to be about supporting African women entering the technology field. Naturally, this caught my interest, and I let Rodney know I was going to be interviewing at Spotify that Monday. We had quite a fun conversation which ended with me promising not to bother him or bring people back for a party at the apartment as I was only staying that one night.

Now, a curious thing about this multi-story flat is there is only one bathroom on the ground floor due the fact the home’s plumbing was originally put in after it was built in the 1700s. The owner informed me we would all need to share that bathroom.

The next morning, I woke up, excited about the Halloween party that night with Hailey. I descended the old and narrow staircase to the first floor to take a shower and found the bathroom empty. In the middle of my shower, I heard a woman’s voice outside the bathroom door clearly say “excuse me, sir?” I assumed it was the owner wanting into the bathroom for some reason, so I yelled in response asking what she needed. No response. I yelled again. Still no response. “Well, that was strange.” I thought.

Saturday afternoon I went downtown and did some exploring before meeting up with Hailey to pre-party for the Halloween night ahead of us. We grabbed some drinks and then went off to one of the most memorable Halloween parties I have ever been to. Imagine 60 or so people from all over the world dressed up in costumes with about a dozen different English accents crammed into a tiny two-story British house, piled on top of each other drinking and having fun. It felt like a peak party in my life!

Afterwards, I slept at Hailey’s. It felt amazing to be with a girl I liked, going to one of the best parties of my life, and now I was going to be hanging in London and soon I was going to have my formal interview to work at my dream job Spotify.

Sunday morning, Hailey’s attitude switched drastically toward me and she was coy about why. She informed me that we had a lot of fun that weekend, but she had a ton of work to do because her new business was starting the following day and she had been partying so much she barely had gotten anything done. She curiously suggested I go back to the AirBnB that night that I had been to on Friday. This was painful for me because I thought we had a good thing going. Confused, that Sunday afternoon I ended up booking the exact same AirBnB for Sunday night.

The next morning at the AirBnB, I went down to take a shower again, and while I was in the shower I was startled to hear a familiar woman’s voice say, “Excuse me, sir?”

It was crystal clear, despite being muffled by the thick wooden bathroom door. It rattled my nerves a bit, being bothered yet again while naked in the shower. How was it possible that this owner was again interrupting at the exact same time?

Despite this, I responded politely, “Yeah, what do you need?”

Except for the gentle running shower water, there was nothing but silence.

Now I was annoyed. How could she not hear? Maybe the shower water was so loud that she could not hear my voice? I turned off the water and shouted even louder, “Hello!? Yeah, what do you need?”

Again, no response.

“Hello? Does somebody need something?”

Listening intently, I heard nobody outside, not even the sound of footsteps. It made absolutely no sense to me that now for the second time someone - clearly a woman who I assumed was the owner - wanted into the bathroom yet again in the middle of my short shower.

As I exited the bathroom, I looked straight ahead to see Rodney sitting at his laptop staring quizzically at me. He was about 9 feet away, directly in front of the bathroom door, facing to my left out into a small courtyard through a window.

“Josh, who were you talking to in there?” he asked.

“Oh, the owner came by and must have wanted something.”

“Josh, we are the only two people in the house right now.”

“You must be mistaken; someone definitely came by the door.”

“Josh, I’ve been sitting here the entire time, and nobody walked by.”

This made no sense, as I had clearly heard a woman’s voice, but Rodney was convinced that nobody came by. We argued for a bit, and Rodney insisted he too had heard some sort of “utterance” in front of the bathroom door. He said it sounded like nothing he had ever heard before and he had looked up at the bathroom when it happened. Confused that nothing was there, he dismissed it until he heard me respond to it. Something had made a noise directly in front of the bathroom and both Rodney and I had heard it, but I was the only one who heard words.

“Josh, are you religious?” Rodney asked, matter-of-factly.

This question triggered me, and I struggled to contain my annoyance. Rodney was obviously implying that some sort of paranormal event had happened because we could not identify who had walked in front of the door. Internally, I sighed. What an idiot. I had intentionally escaped the religious nutcases in the United States to go to an atheist country so I would not have to deal with this stupidity and now a man in London was bringing it up. 

“Oh no, I am not religious. I am an atheist, but I used to be a Christian.” I responded confidently.

“Oh, that must be what this is…” he said, his voice trailing off as if a puzzle piece had clicked in his mind.

I braced myself intellectually. I had spent year after year studying religion, the paranormal, logical debate, and various scientific methods. I was ready to investigate this situation and show Rodney there was an entirely natural explanation.

We continued our discussion, and Rodney made it clear that he was beginning to think what had happened was something spiritual. He explained that he was an Episcopalian Christian and that he believed everything in the Bible had happened even though it did not make sense. He insisted that when I was in the shower, he heard an unearthly noise like nothing he had ever heard before and that he looked and nothing was there to make the noise. And we both agreed that it came from the exact same spot, about “head height in front of the bathroom door” as he described it.

I mustered the last ten years of my scientific education and made it my mission to prove to Rodney that this noise was caused by something physical in the room. My most recent job in Chicago had been working on AI processing of audio signals and I had spent a lot of time studying the physics of sound. This, coupled with my extensive study of debunking the paranormal, had uniquely equipped me for finding the source of this noise.

For what must have been at least thirty minutes, I searched high and low for anything that could have caused a noise. My first thought was that perhaps a pressure differential had been built up somewhere from the hot shower water and steam. It might have been that I thought I heard English and maybe it was just some weird release of hot air.

Skeptical of my skepticism, Rodney insisted that he had stayed at that same AirBnB often when he came to London because he was friends with the owner, and he had never once heard anything like the noise he had heard that day. He was still visibly concerned.

Unfazed, I set up an experiment. I went into the bathroom, where the dial for the temperature of the water was still set exactly where I had left it when I got out. I turned on the water exactly as it was when I was in there, closed the shower curtain, stepped outside the bathroom, and closed the shower door. Curiously, I noticed a large gap under the shower door of at least an inch so I concluded it could not possibly be that the pressure inside the bathroom and outside were great enough to cause a noise since there was more than enough room for air to escape. Regardless, I decided to leave the shower running for as long as needed to hopefully reproduce the noise.

Then with that experiment running, I analyzed everything else about that first floor. It occurred to me that perhaps someone - another guest? - had walked out into the courtyard while Rodney was focused on his work. I mentioned this to Rodney and he absolutely insisted that he looked up immediately upon hearing the sound and nobody was in the room. Not to mention, he was literally looking out into the courtyard right above his laptop screen, so nobody could have come from that direction either.

Becoming more flustered, I began to look for any mechanical or electronic device that could have produced that type of sound. In front of the bathroom door was just your average ceiling. There were no pipes or speakers or any wiring anywhere nearby. The kitchen, likewise, was free of any speakers or anything I could find that could produce a sound like that.

I thought that perhaps a neighboring apartment could have produced a noise, even though the neighboring walls were in the complete opposite direction to where Rodney and I both heard the sound. After rapping my knuckles against the cinder-block wall I abandoned that idea. The cinderblocks were not hollow and were at least six inches thick. It made even less sense that a sound could have somehow gone through those cinder blocks and been heard on the other side of the bathroom.

I was stumped, absolutely stumped. I could not find - and could not even invent! - a natural explanation for what had happened. This voice had now happened twice, on two separate days. And both days were booked independently so the idea that a person was trying to prank me or something similar made no sense.

My shower water experiment had yielded no unusual sounds, so I turned off the water in defeat. The only thing I could think of was that surely the owner must have come by and said something and then somehow left without Rodney seeing her. That was the only explanation that made sense!

As Rodney chatted on about his Christian beliefs while we stood there near the place where the noise was heard, I heard the front door opening to my right. Turning to look, the owner walked in carrying grocery bags in her hand. She had been shopping the entire time. She looked up to see me in deep conversation with Rodney. She had explicitly asked me not to interrupt Rodney while he was working on his video production, and I could see she was confused. She asked us both what was going on.

“Well, I don’t know…” I said hesitatingly. “I was taking a shower, and I thought I heard someone come by the door and say something, but Rodney insisted nobody was there.”

“Josh, I don’t want to alarm you, but this type of stuff happens all the time… this house is haunted.”

My mind blue screened. My mental model of the universe was like an overly inflated balloon, the voice I had heard in the shower was like holding a threatening needle, and this one little phrase was like a gentle tap on its back edge. In one instant, my view of the world collapsed. In all my studies, I had missed something fundamental or both Rodney and I and former guests were having a shared mental delusion. Neither of these explanations gave me much hope.

She continued: “Many guests have seen a woman in this house and asked me about her but there has never been anybody here by her description. But you are the first person who has ever said they heard a voice…”

I had a million thoughts going through my head. How was this possible? Did I experience a dual hallucination with Rodney? How can a non-physical thing produce a voice? And most of all, if ghosts exist, why did one speak to me?

# Chapter 27 – Collapsing Utopia

Despite a million unanswered questions, I needed to rush off to my Spotify interview. I let the owner and Rodney know I needed to head out and caught an Uber to head to Hailey’s WeWork office for a quiet place to take the interview. I added Rodney on LinkedIn so we could stay in touch before I left.

In the cab I remember posting something to my old Instagram account about having my first “haunted house” experience. The playfulness of the post did not belie how confused I truly was. I had utterly failed to come up with a natural explanation of what had happened.

My temporary conclusion was that I did not know what caused those words but perhaps in time I would be able to come up with an explanation. Maybe after some sleep or perhaps some book I might read, an explanation may come to me. Strangely, I put the entire experience on a mental shelf, and something caused me to completely forget about it.

The interview went great, and I got a job at Spotify’s in the Tools team working on an internal product for all the engineers. I was working with by far the smartest engineers I have ever seen and was placed on a product that everyone at the company knew about.  At the time, I imagined I was at the peak of my career.

In addition to having the “perfect” job, I was having fun dating without any limits, partying, and traveling to many countries around Europe. I had become accustomed to the Swedish system enough and had most of my paperwork sorted so for a while things were running smoothly. I found that simply mentioning I worked at Spotify got a lot of attention, which proved useful more than once for networking or getting into bars and clubs. My health was near perfect, I was in shape, and I had no dependents in my life. On the outside, everything was the average man’s dream. I was creating a new life for myself, just as I had planned.

But near the end of 2018, my prospects shifted again. It felt like an invisible force was against me.

One night out, I somehow managed to get the attention of one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen. As I had mentioned before, I had learned some techniques about picking up women and was using some of these techniques with her, got her number, and set up a date.

No matter how hard I tried, I was going to develop feelings for this woman. I was so exhausted of the playboy lifestyle. I desperately wanted a family, not just another hookup. I made it super clear to her that if she did not have feelings for me, I did not want to become intimate. She listened carefully and agreed. As we neared my train stop at Gardet in Stockholm, she started snuggling me and cooing that she could maybe come back to my place for a bit. I thought this was her queue that she had feelings for me.

So back to my place we went, and we started getting intimate. Everything felt wrong. Here I was physically intimate with the most beautiful woman I had ever been with, but instead of enjoying it, I felt like I was dissociating from the experience. I could not enjoy it. It felt like something was sucking the enjoyment away from me. When we finished, she said “thanks, that is just what I needed, I am going to call a cab” and left. I was dumbfounded. Why was it that every time something good started to happen in my life it was like some invisible force was swiping the enjoyment and success from me?

Meanwhile, at work I discovered that a female boss of mine was targeting my male colleagues who crossed her to fire them. I began to do some digging and discovered that my boss was intentionally inventing stories about men to get them fired. Given that this was right during the #metoo movement, nobody was challenging her.

This same boss had given me a small promotion within the team at Spotify, which was mostly just a nominal one. She also began to hold one-on-one meetings with me, and I could sense something was off. As I began to point out that some of her suggestions or ideas did not make full sense, she started to turn against me. In horror, I realized she was trying to trap me, and I might become the next in her list.

Within that same month, another woman I had been seeing off and on was starting to scare me. She opened to me that she had been sleeping with her best friend’s husband before we met. She flippantly threw this story out like it was nothing - leaving me in complete shock. Here was a tiny little Belarussian woman blatantly boasting about cheating on her “best friend” behind her back. And she was proudly telling the story to her new potential boyfriend like it was a conquest!

Of course, I pressed her on this asking if she felt bad about what she had done. She confidently told me she did not feel bad at all with cheating with this husband because her best friend “had everything she wanted”. This made no sense to me. The woman I was seeing had almost no sense of morality, and I was sleeping with her. Was I being too judgmental? Did I just need to lower my moral standards to fit in?

Things only got worse. One day I was with her and a friend, and we were playing a game. I won the game, and she got mad and kicked me. Hard. She had a smile on her face and played it off like she was just “playfully angry”, but I could tell the kick meant more. My gut told me that she meant to hurt me.

This escalated to the point that one day we were physical in bed together and she asked me to do something that crossed a line. Annoyed, I walked to the kitchen where I started making coffee. She came into the kitchen and was escalating things and would just not let it go to the point that I politely asked her to leave my apartment.

She grabbed a few of her things and then came over and stood over me, glaring. I looked at her and without any warning she began attacking me and I held up my hands to block the blows. One after another, in rapid succession, I blocked her hits. Her anger spent, she confidently strode over to the coffee machine as if nothing had happened, looked at it, and turned to me and said “Josh, will you make me breakfast?”

Completely in shock, I responded “no, you just attacked me!”

“No I didn’t.” She said, matter-of-factly.

Then, as if reconsidering her lie, she asked “Josh, are you going to call the police?”

It suddenly occurred to me that there was no way for me to defend myself if she continued lying. Who knows what ridiculous story she would make up. I was in Sweden where I did not know much about dealing with the law. For all I knew, just like with my boss and her firings, the police would just believe her because she was a woman.

Frantically, I quickly came up with a plan. I knew that she was acting calm at this moment and trying to boss me around. She had already ignored my request to leave my apartment, so how was I going to get her to leave? I know, no matter what happened, I needed to start recording.

I grabbed my phone, and started a video recording, pointed it straight at her and calmly said “Daria, I would like you to please grab your things and leave my apartment.”

She looked at me, then at my phone, and the reality of the situation set in. Without a single word, she calmly and methodically walked around the apartment and grabbed her things and left.

As the adrenaline surge began to dissipate, I realized that my left hand hurt. A lot. In fact, one of my fingers hurt so bad I hard time moving it. After some thought I realized that she had been hitting me with her hands and when I held up my hands in defense, she must have broken one of my fingers.

My initial thought was that I should go to the hospital, but then I realized they would ask me what happened, and I was extremely afraid that she might get pulled into the discussion and make a false accusation. Scared, I decided to do nothing and just cut off contact with her.

What really broke that day was not my finger, it was my trust in women and a chunk of society. I knew, right after those blows, that my trust and understanding toward women had been severed to a depth that would take years to heal.

I had leaned heavily into atheism, into feminism, into Swedish culture, and away from all religion with the full belief that the moral problems in the world were primarily due to “false beliefs”. Now I was repeatedly being faced with one situation after another that made it clear to me that some people genuinely do not care about others at all, and I had no idea how to think about or defend myself in that world. I was so alone. My eyes were now opened to reality in a new way, and I was terrified at what I was seeing.

Some of you might recall that back circa 2018 - 2019 the entire “Social Justice Warrior” push had morphed into what is now called “woke”. At its core, those who considered themselves to be woke were people who had “woken up” to the subtle hierarchy of race and gender that ruled our western society. At the top was the cunning evil white, straight, male. This intersection between radical feminism and anti-racism had begun to metastasize into a parasitical mindset that was weaving its way into various institutions.

I had begun to see a censorian sentiment on internal messaging boards and was absolutely appalled to see that some of my colleagues were actively pushing to ban certain people from the platform. Ironically at this time I knew almost nothing about people like Alex Jones except for his iconic barb about “they’re turning the frogs gay!”. To me he was just a brash, loud-mouthed shock-jock. Yet people were for some reason suggesting he should be “deplatformed”.

All of my internal alarm bells started to go off because this had the same vibe as when Pastor Joe tried to silence and shun anyone who wanted to question him. The idea that you needed to silence someone, rather than challenge them publicly made me feel that people were hiding something or were afraid. In the background outside of work, I began to voraciously study what was going on. While I was still avidly against Donald Trump and everything associated with him, I was now beginning to see a side to the political left and these secular idealists that also scared me.

Near the end of 2018, I had thankfully escaped the firing squad of my misandrist and opportunistic manager and moved over to the security department thanks to the help of some friends who saw what was going on. In the security department, a new good friend of mine suggested I start reading a book by a man named Jordan Peterson. The book was “Twelve Rules for Life” and a bunch of the men at Spotify were passing it around. But I was strongly instructed to not let anyone see that I was reading it.

This startled me even further. Not only were there people publicly wanting to deplatform and publicly humiliate and shame famous right-leaning figures at the platform level, but now employees at Spotify were being, shall we say - cautioned - to not let colleagues know they were reading a book by a psychologist from Canada. What in the world could this man be saying that was so bad?

During our first all-hands meeting, it was obvious there was an open gender war about the ratio of men to women employees. Some implied that we were not hiring enough women and that the women we did hire were underpaid and underpromoted. Nobody provided proof of a conspiracy against women, but the mob seemed to believe that unless we had exactly 50% women and 50% men then some hidden cabal of powerful white men were conspiring to keep men in charge. During an all-hands company meeting, someone even mentioned that we must continue working until we have the perfect ratio. Was it true that women were underpaid and that there was a bias in the industry against hiring women?

These comments during the all-hands meeting were quite surprising to me, as I had been told by the media that out of every country on earth, Sweden was the least sexist! Apparently, despite this, the war in Sweden between the sexes was in full swing and I was just now becoming aware of it.

At the time, I was trying to distance myself from politics in many ways, so I was oblivious to the fact that the well-known psychologist and professor Jordan Peterson had given his famous interview with Cathy Newman on January 16, right around the time I was hired. In that interview, Jordan Peterson directly challenged the feminist narrative that women were oppressed in the workplace.

Jordan Peterson was maligned as a malicious patriarchal monster in the media but stood his ground. Peterson repeatedly mentioned a psychological study that was done that showed that the more egalitarian a society is the more women choose traditionally female roles . In other words, if a society were to pay all professions equally, women lean into traditionally feminine roles like nursing, teaching children, cooking, gardening, etc. The scientific conclusion was that if all jobs paid the same, women would more often than not pursue physically risk-averse jobs that maximize motherly instincts and/or social caring. Naturally, for many women who had spent years believing that women were treated as inferior, this scientific study was like a slap in the face.

At this time, I saw myself as the opposite of sexist and a champion of progressive ideals. I was seeing a woman from Sudan who I will call Salma who had escaped an authoritarian Islamic household. In my mind, I was engaging in a relationship with a woman who came from an extremely patriarchal culture. I believed women should do whatever job they found interesting, and that they should be paid exactly as their skill dictates. Additionally, I loved cooking and did not care a bit about woman doing traditional roles. But this new study deeply challenged the narrative I was hearing repeatedly that women in Sweden are oppressed.

My new security manager was a woman I will call Annette. Annette was kind, thoughtful, and hard working. We would have regular one-on-one meetings but due to my experience with my previous manager I was extra cautious now and not so quick to trust someone’s intentions.

An idea popped into my head that perhaps I could do some statistical math to figure out the perfect ratio of men and women for any profession. It occurred to me that men and women have different hormonal makeups and therefore should have statistically different psychological profiles. Would this not influence the careers they choose? A quick check of the Meyers-Briggs (MBTI) results shows that for as long as the test has been performed, each of the sixteen psychological buckets have wildly different ratios of men and women that fall within them. One of the starkest findings is that most men prefer Thinking and women prefer Feeling. No surprise there, older generations have been saying this since time immemorial. This conclusion appeared to be independent of the cultural background of those taking the test. Naturally, this means that there would be more INTJ men than women and more INFJ women than men. Because many school counseling programs use the MBTI results to advice young people into a career, there should be a statistical difference in the first years of college of those who entire computer science degrees. Could I calculate what this exact percentage was?

Having done some statistics work, I created a rudimentary spreadsheet and looked up some historical data and started plugging it in. Studies have shown that a limited set of MBTI types work best with computers, so anyone could easily calculate what percentage of men versus women there are for each of these MBTI profiles and aggregate them into a single number. Shocked, I discovered that the perfect balance would be roughly 40% women and 60% men – very, very close to the ratio that Spotify currently had among its employees. This indicated that Spotify was not biased against women in their hiring.

Excited, and ignorant of mob mentality, I decided to discretely show this to a couple friends. They immediately got scared and told me to never show this to anyone. One boss that I trusted asked if I had heard of Jordan Peterson. He was speaking in hushed tones, as if some progressive gestapo could find out we were talking and destroy our lives.

Why was simply bringing up facts being met with fear? I decided to keep my spreadsheet quiet.

For a reason I do not remember, shortly thereafter I decided to post a link directly to the Gender Paradox study on my Facebook wall. I included no personal comments, just the link. My female manager saw it and started a debate with Salma on my Facebook wall and things got a little heated. Despite Salma being from a deeply oppressed society, she agreed with the scientific study. My female boss – from Sweden – refused to listen to her. I could feel tension rising.

The next day, that manager messaged me on the internal Spotify Slack that she had seen my post on Facebook and that she thought I was not educated on the important values that Spotify holds. She instructed me that I was to read some documents on women in the workplace, and we would have a follow-up meeting to go over what I learned. She then told me that if I did not comply, she could make my career very difficult. There was zero mention of the data in the scientific study, she completely ignored it.

My stress level skyrocketed. This reminded me so much of Pastor Joe pulling me into the office to instruct me that I was to bend to his will. I truly believed the left, and Swedish culture, was about reason and science! I knew I was being bullied… again. My entire philosophy that pursuing truth and honesty and throwing off religious ideas would lead to a peaceful life was being shattered.

At this time James Damore was famous in the media for being kicked out of Google for raising concerns about gender equality in the workplace, and when I heard about him I felt I was going to be next. I could not just lose my job and get a new one. My entire residency in Sweden - my entire life - was now tied to this job. If I got fired for being “misogynistic” in Sweden it could be the death-knell of my life there. I might need to leave and return to the United States. The terror at the prospect of being fired, kicked out Sweden, and ending up on the news for being mislabeled a misogynist was heavy on my mind.

After reading the written materials prescribed by Annette, my manager decided to meet one-on-one with me to review what I had “learned”. I came prepared. Sweden is a one-party consent state for recording conversations. In other words, you can legally record a conversation - especially at work - without the other person’s consent. Having had a previous one-on-one conversation with a female manager who was trying to trap me and having seen multiple men fired by aggressive women on trumped-up charges, I knew that I needed to record the entire conversation.

In short, I informed Annette in the most diplomatic way possible that I had read the materials and while I agreed to some extent, I thought the story that was being told by the material was one-sided. With each sentence, I imagined how it would sound if it were played back during an HR meeting. I then told her that I sympathized with those who felt oppressed. I told her about how I had been attacked by a girlfriend, and she had broken my hand. I told my manager how I had been afraid to go to anyone because I knew that women were favored in society.

Her face grew slightly pale, and she paused. The entire vibe of the room shifted. I could see she was deeply conflicted. She apologized for what had happened to me and I could tell that my story was conflicting with her ideologies. The message being pumped through left-wing media was to always believe the victims, and here she was talking to a victim. But I was a white, straight male. I was not supposed to be the victim; I was supposed to be the abuser!

Shortly after that bombshell, she ended the meeting. She never spoke to me about it again.

I was a mess. Every hope that I had about Sweden being this loving secular society was being crushed. Within a few months, I had gone from feeling on top of the world to depressed and beyond stressed. I was terrified one manager was trying to fire me, a girlfriend attacked me and broke my hand when I asked her to leave my apartment for being mean, and now not only was my career being threatened but my entire life in Sweden might end if I agreed with a scientific study. My Swedish utopia was turning into hell, and I was not even sure I enjoyed working at Spotify anymore.

# Chapter 28 – Rock Bottom

The rollercoaster of hopes and dashed expectations that summer had me spiraling. There are half a dozen other negative stories I could tell during this tumultuous period that fit the same theme as the previous chapter. Most of them involved friends caught in lies or cheating, radical feminism, abuse and manipulation, and generally negative attitudes towards men.

Early in the year I felt that I at least had reached a pinnacle in my achievements for someone 33 years old who grew up homeschooled in the Midwest. I was a respected engineer at Spotify, working on a solid product, and traveling the world. I was collecting a great salary at least for Swedes and was living in a country that was considered the happiest in the world. But I was becoming more miserable every day. It felt like a heavy invisible hand was pushing back against my further advancement at every turn.

Shortly after the incident with Annette, I got invited by a few Spotify friends to go to Ibiza for an EDM concert. My friend and I rented scooters and planned to explore the island, while we settled into our hotel. I was hoping that the escape from the pressures at work would ease the constant stress I was feeling.

The first day, we met some girls from another hotel nearby. All the girls were cute, but one stood out and I remember imagining how I could get her attention despite the fact I had another woman back in Sweden vying for my attention. In Swedish culture it is extremely common to date and even sleep with multiple people before picking the one you want and nobody bats an eye until you declare you are officially together - usually not until after you realize you have been living together for six months and have shared custody of an entire assortment of Ikea furniture and a dog. But I digress.

It was the 3rd of September, 2018 and the six of us decided to do a boat trip to go see a lighthouse overlooking a cliff. On the ferry ride back, I remember the girl I thought was cute talking about how she was a biologist. She proudly declared that she was an atheist and thought all supernatural phenomena was ridiculous and she could debunk anything. Suddenly I remembered for the first time the ghost voice I had heard in that AirBnB in London and my failed attempts to debunk it.

In an instant I realized I had my “in” with this woman and it was a perfect win regardless of which way it went. I challenged her on her ability to debunk anything and told her I had a story that she could probably not debunk. If she could debunk the ghostly voice in my story, I would get an answer to the question I had had for nearly a year and also have a chance at getting to know her a little better. If she could not debunk it, then I had “won” the challenge. Either way, it was a way to build a little bit of a connection with her.

She confidently said she could easily debunk whatever story I had and asked me to share it with her. While the salty waves tossed our boat up and down I told her - and everyone else listening - an abbreviated version of the story. At first, she was intensely interested and asked great questions, but then as I continued the story while detailing about Rodney and my attempts to debunk the voice, she became quite quiet. Nobody could think of an explanation.

I had a hard time sleeping that night as I could not stop thinking about what had just happened. Did I truly have a proper supernatural experience? If so, this was truly remarkable. During my Moody days, I had researched hundreds of paranormal and supernatural stories and nobody had one like mine. But concerningly, why had I completely forgotten about that event until this moment on the boat? It perplexed me that somehow the entire experience had been shoved out of my mind for nearly a year now. It was such an extraordinary experience, why had I been blinded to it? Why did I suddenly feel the need to take that experience seriously?

As I contemplated, I thought of the few questions she did ask about the layout of the house and the position of the ghostly voice. So I decided - despite it being nearly a year later - to sketch out the layout of the main floor where the voice was heard. Grabbing a pen and paper, I did a rough sketch of the entire thing as I remembered it. The sketch was rough but everything fit as I remembered. After I finished sketching, I stared at it long and hard and there was no reasonable explanation that I could come up with other than I had heard a ghost. After the trip, my life went back to normal and I never heard from those girls again.

By early 2019, I was starting to like a new woman at work and was contemplating breaking up with the woman from Africa that I was dating. Selfishly, I decided the drama with the girl I was dating was too much and that she was depending on me as her savior of sorts (her words) and decided to break things off with her to potentially date this new woman at Spotify. I felt very guilty for this breakup.

The first date with this new girl who I will call Mila was fun: we ate Ramen at a cozy little spot on the central island of Sodermalm in Stockholm. Despite having a great time, afterwards it felt to me that she was giving me a bit of a cold shoulder. Having been in Sweden for a while now and seeing how rare it was for anyone to let themselves emotionally attach in a relationship before having sex and often with multiple partners at the same time, I was getting quite frustrated with this little game of acting disinterested and dating multiple people at once. I sensed that inevitably what might be coming is her giving a “thanks, but no thanks” response. I was becoming exhausted at this dating culture.

At the time I had some vesting options in Spotify stock. That next week I got an email from our company’s online trading platform letting me know that I had forgotten to sign a piece of foreign declaration paperwork regarding my options in Spotify. Spotify had just completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO) and employees were given vesting options. The paperwork had to do with disclosing to the SEC my ownership of options in foreign shares but owing taxes to the Swedish government. While my Spotify options were perhaps worth only $10k at the time, the shares were an order of magnitude more. Long story short, the email said that if I did not physically sign, send, and have a document approved by someone in New York by close of business day then the trading platform was going to send to the IRS taxes on the full value of the stock! This was going to be something like $50k if I remember correctly, because the shares were worth significantly more than the options. State another way, if I did not sign a piece of paper and get it approved within about 8 hours, the trading platform was going to send nearly $50k to the IRS (and I would owe them) and let me deal with the headache of getting my money back. I nearly panicked.

Because I was home and did not have a printer and scanner, I quickly got my coat on and rushed to the Spotify office. It must have been around 8pm when I arrived and as quickly as I could I printed off the paperwork to sign it. Time was ticking. My heart was beating, and I was so unbelievably stressed. My entire salary at that time was less than $100k (USD) and I had drained my savings because the move to Sweden and associated expenses were so much more than I anticipated and I had not adjusted my lifestyle to match a lower income. I could not afford this to happen.

As I impatiently stood there printing the paperwork in Spotify’s printer room, my phone vibrated. It was a text from Mila. It was an open-ended generic text about having a great time on our date but for the next week she was busy. Given my experience dating in Sweden, I took this as code for “I like you, but I’m probably still dating other people, and you are not at the top of my list.”

I looked at the printer and then at the text. The stress overflowed and I lost it. This was too much for one evening. Not only was I about to see myself in a massive financial crisis, I was now dealing with another failed romance. This was too much.

Quickly, I responded with a flippant text wanting to just forget about her. I signed the paperwork, scanned it, and got it emailed off to the trading platforms New York office.

An hour later - as I tossed and turned in bed - my nerves were still raw and I was full of anxious adrenaline. I could not sleep. I had not received any notice from New York that they had received the paperwork, and I knew that I was not going to get to sleep until I got confirmation, which might not be until nearly 4am.

My mind raced over every negative event the last several months that had led me to this point of loneliness and frustration. Why did it feel like something invisible was against me? I could still taste and visualize the utopian dream I had when first arrived in Sweden at the Arlanda airport. That dream was dying: the dream of being surrounded by beautiful healthy secular people, of being rich in Stockholm, of creating this life where I would meet some lovely atheist woman and settle down and have a family while I advanced my software career. The dream of regularly going out to fancy European dining locations and traveled to a new country every month. A dark reality had wrapped itself like a snake around my feeling of being on top of the world and was now squeezing every ounce of joy and peace out of my life.

My arrival in Sweden was met with a murder. The first company I joined ran out of money. The second job had two managers that seemed hell-bent against my career for completely different reasons. The first girlfriend I had turned out to be a poor fit and dealing with extreme trauma from her past. That ended with me completely having a broken heart which still hurt. Another girlfriend attacked me and broke my hand. Another woman used me for sex after I explicitly said that I only wanted a relationship. I was repeatedly turned down by women that seemed more stable. Financially, I had somehow made it nearly two years into my foreign adventure with a decrease in my wealth despite working at one of the most desirable technology companies in the world. And here I was fighting a paperwork battle because dealing with government paperwork while being a citizen in one country and moving to another can be such a nightmare. And now I was contemplating all of this while lying in a tiny bed in the smallest apartment I had ever lived in trying to save money in the pitch darkness and cold of a Swedish winter. Alone.

I was an empty shell, stripped of any sense of direction and meaning. I felt defeated. My life consisted of chasing sexual highs, drinking and partying, feeding my ego, and indulging in new experiences while hoping to someday be rich and make it big in a startup.

My apartment was empty and still. Outside, I could occasionally hear a car drive by or some people chatting and laughing as they flitted by in the hallway. Artificial light drifted in from my balcony, casting gentle shadows. My tiny cozy apartment felt like a cage in that moment.

Depressed, I contemplated my situation - deeply.

Like most of my friends in Sweden, I was making less than half what my engineering friends in the United States were making. Saving up for a down payment on a house or flat in Sweden was extremely difficult, yet another goal of mine that was failing. The friends that I did meet who owned places tended to get them through inheritance. Even in Sweden, the land of equality, generational wealth plays a massive role. My financial future looked bleak.

I could hear gentle partying in the distance, making me feel even more alone as my thoughts continued.

Back in the United States, my college friends were now wealthy and some of them were buying second or third homes. At my current salary it might take me another two to three years to save up enough to buy a nice one bedroom condo in Stockholm. And then how long would it take me to pay it off? The Swedish system involves corporate taxes that make high-level salaries nearly impossible to get. 

And then what: would I just live alone endlessly until I died, getting older without being able to find a wife? I was certainly not getting younger, and I had definitely noticed that since my hairline started receding that I was getting less attention from women and also was finding it harder to maintain the same level of physique.

Many of my friends back in the states were married and having kids and I could not keep a single stable girlfriend for longer than six months. Why was every attempt of mine at love failing? I had no problem getting attention from women, but it felt like my repeated failures were statistically improbable. Friends, even female friends, would regularly act like they were surprised that I was not with someone long-term. Why was I such a failure?

Ugly suicidal thoughts were creeping into my mind. This was not the first time this happened. I had many times been on my balcony, frustrated, and heard what felt like my own voice urging me to jump. The feeling of overwhelming darkness and depression settled in more deeply as my thoughts continued.

My family back in the United States - the religious “nuts” - were seemingly moving on with their lives without me. My brother and his wife and kids and their Cockatoo seemed to be doing well. So much of my emotional effort as an atheist was to eschew every ounce of my religious upbringing and prove that you can be a happy, successful atheist and live a normal and moral life just as well as any Christian. Clearly I was failing.

Should I just end things? I was a failure, and it sure seemed that despite all my best efforts, the universe had rejected me. With each day of failures and opposition, I felt my dreams were never going to become reality. Everything I did, every high ideal I had was just an illusion. Women only were using me because they tolerated me, not because any of them cared about me.

I had put in so much effort into understanding Swedish culture, but I knew I was never going to fully “fit in” in Sweden. Everyone born there was more connected than me to the culture, and no matter how hard I tried I was still going to be an outsider. What if I gave up on Sweden and moved back to the states? But if I did that, I was going to have to start over again - setting me back even further financially. Everything felt dark and hopeless. I could just jump off the balcony… no, no this was ridiculous. What was telling me to do this? I was resilient, I was strong, and I was smart. What was I missing?

I shoved the suicidal thoughts down as deep as I could, and tried to think rationally.

What events led to my current situation? To my shame, I realized that it sure seemed that every single problem in my life was due to my choices. I had turned down plenty of kind and considerate women who wanted to settle down and have a family so I could be a playboy. I was lying to myself that I only wanted a family, I was trying to have my cake and eat it too. My career decisiosn were no better. Shortly before I moved to Sweden, I had turned down one of the best job offers I ever got in my life that would have assured that I would have been a millionaire. I turned it down because I felt I could do better, despite a good friend reassuring me it was a fantastic choice. Was I stupid? To top it off, it was me, and me alone, that decided to move to Sweden. And then when I had applied to Spotify I had another job offer for more money, but I explicitly chose to take a job that paid less at Spotify to pad my resume.

And what about dating? I knew early on that Daria was trouble, but something sexual and chaotic was drawing me to her against every ounce of wisdom I possessed. So when she attacked me, it was not without warning. And the reality was that I had broken up with the Sudanese girl because I thought I could “do better”. Salma had done nothing wrong, she was just struggling and I did not want to deal with it. I selfishly broke things off with her so that I could pursue another woman I thought was more attractive and more stable…

“Excuse me, sir?”

Out of my morose fog, something reminded me of that mysterious female voice in the AirBnB. What if that was a real living spiritual being that spoke to me? What would that mean? Maybe I was not truly ever alone, maybe there was more going on in the world behind the scenes that could explain my situation?

If that ghost was real, then this would clearly mean that my life was being observed by at least one spiritual being. And if there was one spiritual being that could possibly exist, then there might be thousands or even millions of spiritual beings. And if this is the case, there may be something like a God.  It might not be the God I grew up learning about, but some type of spiritual God could be possible. Hard to prove, but it at least is conceivable.

But what God might there be? I had studied Christianity and the data and arguments against it to such depth that I could not muster a single believable thought about that God. Jesus’ attitude and most of his teachings seemed legit, and I could get behind the morals, but I had disproven beyond any doubt that Christianity was true. Just because some aspects of the Christian faith are attractive does not mean its supernatural claims are true. Christianity is off the table, I reassured myself, but what if there was some sort of ultimate spiritual being out there that was not the Christian God?

Another wave of sickening despair at my miserable life hit me again.

What if that ghostly voice had been the answer to my prayer from nearly ten years before? When I became an atheist, I had prayed that one final prayer for an event that proved God, angels, or aliens or “whatever might be out there” to show itself to me. My request was for something to happen more than once, for there to be a witness present, and that I could not come up with a natural explanation. The event in that AirBnB happened twice, on two separate days. There was a witness present. And here I was nearly a year after that AirBnB event, and I still could not come up with a natural explanation for what had happened. Was this the answer to my prayer?

It was now late into the night, and it felt the winter darkness was only exceeded by the darkness in my soul. I was so alone, and I was vacillating rapidly between suicidal thoughts, angst, anger, despondence and despair.

Maybe a spiritual being was watching me even now in my bed? Maybe just as that ghost showed up unannounced in that AirBnB, maybe I was not truly alone right now? Could I reach out and speak to whatever might be listening?

Swallowing my ego, I mustered every fiber of my will and prayed:

“God, angels, or whatever might be out there. I don’t know if you are real or if you truly exist, but I think you might. I don’t know what you want but all I know is that I am tired of living for myself.”

# Chapter 29 – Demon Returns

As soon as that last word of the prayer existed my lips, out of the darkness and without any warning the atmosphere of my entire apartment morphed into the most horrid and vile presence I had ever experienced in my life. It felt like a spherical bubble of darkness and hate was emanating from a huge invisible being that I somehow sensed was directly in front of me. Though no words were said, I knew it wanted to kill me.

It was nearly ten years since I had experienced “the presence” of a demonic being. Those experiences were shadows from a past I had run away from, and I had concluded they were just hallucinations of a religiously raised mind. I had forgotten what the demonic presence felt like. This was a horrid but familiar feeling - but I did not remember it ever being this intense. 

This invisible being towered above me, seemingly extending its non-physical form through ceiling, walls and floor - invisible and yet its presence was causing a reaction in me that was as real as if I had just noticed a starving lion about to pounce. I did not see eyes, but I could tell it was glaring at me with murder.

I froze and felt goosebumps form all over my body. My pupils dilated. A tiny ray of light streamed in from my balcony, but it provided no comfort.

This was so real I was afraid this thing might materialize in front of my eyes. I was scared I might have a heart attack.

What in the world had I done?

Clearly, that last sentence I spoke had triggered this event. I am tired of living my life for myself. Why would that phrase trigger a return of this evil presence? I was praying for some help from a good being, so why did this happen? All my religious training did not help me explain what was happening in front of me. I had absolutely no idea what to do. I was a flea in the presence of a monster and had no way to defend myself. And yet, I was still alive. If this being could kill me, it certainly was taking its sweet time. What was I missing?

By giving up and humbly asking for help, did I just do that Christian thing and repent? Did I trigger a jealousy in a being that had been secretly influencing my life? Was this dark being the thing that was stamping every ounce of joy and success from life?

The fear intensified. Stupefied, I prayed the first thing I could mutter:

“God, if you are there, please protect me from this thing.”

A still and barely perceptible voice emanated, silent but resolute, from the depths of my long-neglected soul:

“I will protect you.”

Nothing can describe the consolation of hearing God speak a promise directly to you. For a moment, I was granted a spiritual vision of my own soul, which was a dark and empty void of loneliness. Deep in the recesses of the darkness within me I saw a tiny flame glimmer into existence. It was no more than a barely perceptible ember in a void of lonely darkness.

That’s it? What is that going to do? I remember thinking.

None of this made intellectual sense, but a semblance of peace settled into my soul as I felt that thing slink off into wherever non-corporeal beings go to sulk. True, I was still scared, but this was the first time in so long that an encouraging word was spoken to my soul it felt like discovering a bucket of a water in a desert.

The legal paperwork was accepted, just in time.

The following days I felt as I imagine a hoarder feels when someone first tries to clean their house. I felt as if I had ashamedly allowed some cleaning expert into a hidden filth-ridden room in my house to flip on the light. The shock at seeing just how awful things had become in my soul was painful, but the light was bringing the first rays of hope. I had hit rock bottom, and I needed help. 

I once had appendicitis and required surgery. Before the operation I was offered morphine. Additionally, after the surgery I was given both codeine and Vicodin. After taking these medications for a few days, I realized that my back did not hurt. I had been living with constant back pain for so long that it was not until the pain was removed that I realized how bad it had become. Likewise, my soul had been in so much pain for so long that the tiniest rays of hope and relief from a heavenly voice awakened me to how dire my situation truly was.

As the next weeks passed, I remember being manic in my desire for media, articles, books, and obscure stories related to the supernatural and paranormal. I already knew the Bible well, so I knew that repentance and God’s protection were thematic in Christianity, but the ghostly voice in London and the dark being in my room did not neatly fit into any Christian paradigm that I knew about. I was full of new questions. On my off hours, I traded regular partying for soaking up every ounce of information I could find.

I was reluctant to talk to my friends about what was going on because I was embarrassed of their response if they heard that the “intellectual atheist” Josh was now experiencing “spiritual” things. But secretly, I knew I could not ignore reality. I became an atheist on the principle that the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it was, must be accepted. Just as I once spent countless hours studying Christianity and science when leaving the faith, I now began to spend countless hours alone trying to figure out where I went wrong.

I felt the presence of dark energy or beings daily. To be fair, I could tell the energy of the beings was demonic, but surprisingly I was still skeptical that actual demons existed. Strangely, I was primarily experiencing their presence when I was wide awake and at home alone. In the shower, it felt as if something was nearly breathing on my neck or could just simply reach out and grab me, and in bed at night I can remember feeling like the same being - or beings - were trying to force upon me the same fear that they had achieved that first night. Something was protecting me, however. I never physically saw one and they never physically touched me. What were these things? Was I losing my mind? Why did they hate me so much? God, what is happening and why me?

# Chapter 30 – Collapsing Atheism

Clearly, I was shaken emotionally and spiritually, but the most difficult part was trying to take the experiences I was having and funnel them in a meaningful mental model that made sense. For an entire year after that event in London I had been in denial, then I was angry at this invisible force ruining my life, and now I was bargaining.

Software engineers spend considerable time taking in abstract concepts and facts about the world and attempting to distill them into concrete models that can be written as a computer program. This was what I did, day after day, and I considered myself to be quite good at it. I was quite proud of my ability to distill extremely complex problem sets into a simple solution.

But in interpreting this situation, I was at a complete loss. I tried hard to muster all the knowledge I had about the world to form a theory as to what could possibly be happening.

Physics had taught me that the world was a place built up from elementary particles like quarks and protons. These particles, when combined, produced more complex objects. We have many forces that perhaps we can mathematically describe or predict but there are no working models as to why they exist. For example, scientists can model the gravitational force with such accuracy that they can fling tiny spaceships around the sun toward a planet with high precision, relying on gravitational forces to guide the craft to the desired location. But nobody can show why gravity exists or why the Higgs Boson exists. It is one thing to describe and model our observations, it is a completely different thing to know why things work the way they do.

Chemistry had taught me that electrons, protons, and neutrons merge to form a set of foundational objects we call molecules. The foundational molecules make up a limited set we call the Periodic Table. Molecules combine to form tiny little “machines” at the molecular level. These tiny particles jostle around each other in innumerable numbers across our universe, working within the bounds of forms of energy like hydrogen bonding or radiation to create everything from the soft rhythm of ocean waves to the protein creation process of a cell, or even a destructive atomic bomb. Scientists have discovered what appear to be something like “rules” that govern these tiny particles. All atomic particles seem to consistently follow these “rules” without fail. Because of these rules, people like me, software engineers, can model and predict things about the world using computers.

Biology taught me that these particles and their associated “rules” enable the existence of processes that allow the simplest of life forms. Each tiny prokaryotic single-cell creature functions to viciously defend themselves, gather molecular resources, and reproduce. Above them are the eukaryotic cells, slightly more complex perhaps but still without an apparent conscious awareness of their environment. I had spent limited time watching bacterium under a microscope, but I had seen how ruthless this world can be. Everything in the lower life forms on this planet can be reduced to a ruthless quest for resources and energy to reproduce. Death of larger creatures is a feast for those down below.

Above the single-cell creatures fans out a plethora of lifeforms, including us, humans. Our existence is enabled by the harmony of an intake of our resources and reproduction of our own genetic material by mating. The individual creature may eventually decay, due to complex “rules” in the universe about entropy, but by reproducing through tiny machines in a single cell, our species can continue without us. Life forms have sensors that exist to help our minds perceive what things in our environment are beneficial or detrimental to the continued existence of our own genes. If a creature survives by having more highly performing sensors or having internal machinery that happens to fit better in an environment - well then, that creature’s genes have the highest probability of being propagated through mating. Life is conquest for resources and reproduction. The reason that creatures cooperate with each other is because symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationships often help with this entire system. Life on this planet is the beautiful contrast between onion layer after layer of complex systems and the contrast between death and reproduction.

Psychology taught me that the human mind is a sensory response and internal regulation machine. We taste sweetness and our brain knows the food may provide essential energy resources. We feel gentle sunlight and some cells shout out that sunlight is good for producing this little molecule we humans call Vitamin D. We see a beautiful woman or handsome man and with a strong internal force, our reproductive centers go on high alert as numerous cells in our body prepare for the possibility of permanently passing on our genes. All of this happens as a part of layers of systems, many of which may be completely unconscious of what is happening. When we have children, our hormones kick in for child-rearing and the process start over. Our minds are simply a complex machine to increase the efficiency of survival and reproduction.

As such, our brains are not designed first and foremost to discover truth, but they simply exist as a mechanism to find and create the best environment for first our own bodies and then second for the propagation of our genetic material through mating. All the things we love like jazz and old-fashioned cocktails and a fireplace on a cold evening are simply environments of comfort that let us know that we are safe. And when we hug our family and friends our senses signal to our brains a reminder that we are part of a safe community and safety is comfort for our bodies and a reliable environment to mate. And so, the circle of life continues, only interrupted by the harsh forces of nature or of other creatures viciously defending their turf and attempting to reproduce their own genetic material.

This was how I understood life. So how was it possible for a living being to exist that was not built up from these foundational particles? The idea that a demonic being or an angelic being could exist was just an absurd notion that uneducated people held. As already stated, I knew that conscious sensory experiences exist as parts of signal systems that help creatures collect energy resources to survive or reproduce. What purpose was there to feeling fear or hunger or heat in a realm where death was not possible and reproduction were lacking? Stated another way, what purpose were feelings in a realm that was not derived from evolution and a struggle for resources and reproduction? The spiritual realm made zero sense, and yet here I was with multiple experiences that seemed to involve a living creature that by all appearances did not fit anything that I had learned in science!

Who was that voice in that apartment in the AirBnB? And who was this being in my bedroom? And who was that voice telling me it was going to protect me?

Was I losing my mind, just like millions of other religious deluded people throughout history?

To be fair, the data was clear that the ghostly apparition in London was not an experience isolated to my own mind. I did audibly hear that woman’s ghostly voice in that apartment. Simultaneously, an “utterance” was also audibly heard by Rodney as well from the exact same location, at the exact same time. Clearly gas molecules in the air were jostled by something from that point in space in front of that bathroom door, their vibrations moving rapidly toward our eardrums, triggering our sensory systems to respond. If that moment in the AirBnB had not happened, I would have not been prompted to pray a year later. And if I had not prayed, the demonic being would not have shown itself. This all made sense religiously, but it made no sense scientifically. But Rodney and I had heard a different thing, so whatever set of vibrations were emanating from that point hit our eardrums quite differently. How was this even possible?

Two old stories from the Bible bubbled up into my mind. John 12:29 says “The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.” This seems an odd thing to report. Why would the writer report information that casted doubt on the event, unless it did happen? Likewise, the child Samuel in the Old Testament mistook the voice of an angel for his adopted father Eli. These two passages from thousands of years described similar types of experiences to what I happened to me.

However, I did not hear some angel give a long treatise about some judgment from God, like Samuel had experienced. The “message” I received was not spiritual at all. The message in that London bathroom was simply an interjection. I heard a woman’s voice say, “Excuse me, sir?” and nothing more! The only “religious” overtone to the entire thing was that Rodney said he was an episcopalian Christian. Was this a sign of some sort?

The owner of the apartment complex said others had seen a woman who does not exist walking around the apartment. What I experienced was not a typical angel. What was an undead woman doing there in the first place? Or more fundamentally, why would a non-corporeal being inhabit a single location?

We living creatures build homes for protection. Nests, roofs and walls serve as barriers to keep out the elements and predators. If a ghost exists, what need could it possibly have to reside in a house? Because it has no physical body to maintain, it does not need food, it does not need drink, and by all ghostly reports it can just walk through walls.

Additionally, ghost reports of visible apparitions always have them wearing clothes. Bull! If ghosts do not have physical bodies, then clothing makes absolutely no sense! What is the point of clothing on a non-corporeal being? What is the point of a body at all? If you cannot eat, why do you need a mouth, or a stomach, or a butt? If you can simply drift through walls, why do you need legs? What is the point of appearing as a woman in the first place? The concept of a ghost is utterly absurd!

And yet, all the data indicated I heard from one. Every moment of this intellectual exercise was torture. I just wanted to go back to my partying oblivious ways. But I could not ignore what happened any more.

Well, for one, the ghostly voice certainly got my attention. Perhaps this was the only purpose? The words themselves contained no tangible information. They could have just as easily said “Excuse me, sir, could you please go to the small Catholic parish exactly 3 blocks west on Lockhart lane at 10:20 tomorrow.” At least then I would have received something of substance.

To be fair, the entire experience was enigmatic. Deep down I knew it might be the answer to that final prayer I tossed into the void when I became an atheist. God or whatever heard me could have chosen to waltz into my life with thunder and fire and rage at my lack of belief. Instead, in answer to my prayer, while I was on the high of my life and heading toward a peak of self-indulgent pleasure and intellectual arrogance, I was given a simple and gentle feminine voice addressing me with the utmost respect. “Excuse me, sir?” the voice spoke aloud, but the intention of those three words seemed to communicate “What on earth are you doing with your life…”

Despite my complete inability to figure out what or who that was that made the feminine voice speak to me, I began to accept that it might be a real living being. The data did not fit any science that I had ever learned, but a good scientist must accept the data even if it is uncomfortable. The event was not in my mind because I had a witness, and it was not natural because I could not – nor could anyone else – come up with a natural explanation. I was determined to find out what was going on in this wild world and where I had gone wrong in my meticulous study before becoming an atheist.

# Chapter 31 – New Data

Every person has a mental model of the universe. We receive data from our senses, and our brain uses this data to build up an interpretation about how the universe works. Because we are often experiencing new things, our mental model changes daily. Sometimes we experience massive shifts that psychologists call a paradigm shift. As new data comes in, we must rebuild – or refactor – our mental model to match the new data. When we avoid uncomfortable data to preserve our mental model, this is tantamount to denying reality. It is not only unintelligent to ignore some data, but it is potentially dangerous!

Up until this point, my mental model was that every supernatural and paranormal experience (including my own) could be categorized as one or more of the following:

•	Fallacious reasoning
•	Bad information
•	Emotional hysteria
•	Mental illness
•	Drug-induced hallucination
•	Intentional deception
•	Anthropomorphizing natural phenomena

As a child, I had several poignant spiritual experiences. Until now, I assumed that because my kid brain was filled with religious hogwash, I was naturally interpreting the world through that religious lens. My spiritual experiences as a child could simply be lumped into a combination of the above. Because spiritual experiences had ceased for nearly ten years after becoming a die-hard atheist, I had concluded that religious belief itself was the catalyst for spiritual experiences. But the experience in the AirBnB had so directly answered my prayer from ten years before that it was shattering my entire mental model of the universe. I had new data. Obviously, my mental model was wrong. How annoying. I was going to have to rethink everything!

Using the scientific method, a person starts with simple observation and then forms a hypothesis. Naturally, a person should test their hypothesis to make sure that it accurately describes reality. One problem with testing a hypothesis is that humans are often blinded by their own biases and create tests that confirm what they want to be true and not what is true. As a result, back in the 1930s Ronald Fisher formalized the idea of a null hypothesis. He proposed that tests should propose that something is not happening and look for evidence it is. By trying to prove that a hypothesis is not happening, the bias of the scientist hopefully shifts away from a temptation to prove what they want to prove.

In my case, I had set up a null hypothesis when I was at Moody Bible Institute. My null hypothesis was that no spiritual beings exist, even though I really wanted Christianity to be true. Becoming an atheist was a personal scientific experiment. I began that experiment with a prayer to any supernatural thing to reveal itself to me using a set of defined parameters. For nearly ten years, the fact that nothing happened was proof to me that the null hypothesis was true. Ergo, no spiritual things exist.

For nearly ten years, I concluded that the supernatural is a hot load of garbage and that religion was like a “mind virus” that hooks itself into the psyche. By gleefully waltzing into atheism and some form of hedonism I was leaving every iota of work up to whoever these other beings are and then just moving on. If they existed, they had my address and knew about my prayer.

Some of you might be annoyed I set up an experiment that they themselves cannot reproduce. I am aware that scientific experiments should be reproducible. Naturally, this was why I requested that the supernatural event happen more than once.
Now some of you might be thinking, “Josh, this is ridiculous! Numerous people have asked God for evidence and did not have anything happen!” That is correct, and I acknowledge that objection.

However, if spiritual beings exist, we have a unique conflict with the scientific method. The scientific method works best when the tests can be performed in an isolated environment. If spiritual beings exist in some set of dimensions of reality that are not easily accessible by our physical objects, then any scientific test would need to account for this. Essentially, our test must account for the will of these external beings and the unknown limits placed on their actions in these other dimensions. No matter what test we set up for the spiritual, we cannot fully isolate the environment, and we must have the willful participation of the spiritual beings. In other words, scientific methods are incapable of proving fact claims about spiritual beings unless the beings themselves both will to and are capable of participation. This would account for why not everyone gets the same type of response when asking for evidence from the spiritual.

Despite this, at this point I knew that I did not have enough data to conclude that the foundational claims of Christianity were true. Some of the claims of Christianity seemed feasible at this point. After all, if one paranormal event did happen, it opens the possibility to other paranormal events described in religious literature – including the Bible. These events might contradict each other or not make any rational sense, but my own experience did not make much rational sense. Perhaps they all did happen, but there was an explanation for them other than any religion has ever proposed?

# Chapter 32 – UFOs above the Park

After what I believed might be God telling me He would protect me, I kept most of my thoughts to myself and buried myself in private study. I tried hard to live out a normal day-to-day by attending my job at Spotify without giving in that I was mentally shaken. I was in one of the most secular countries on the planet and I was afraid of being labeled mentally ill without any analysis of the facts. My recent experiences with a mob-like mentality had shown me that everyone was capable of cultlike behavior to dismiss data they do not like!

To double-check my newfound conclusion that the spiritual was a real thing, it was essential that I contact Rodney. Rodney had also heard the voice in that flat in London, and I wanted to make sure that my memory of the incident matched his. As mentioned earlier, I collected his LinkedIn during our final conversation before rushing off to my Spotify interview. So I sent Rodney a short message on March 24, 2019:

Hey there Rodney,

Not sure if you remember me, but we had the “haunted” incident at the AirBnB in London!

Long story short I would love to have a chat, as what happened has kick-started a change in my life and something you said has stuck with me. Let me know if you have some time.

Rodney had quite a busy schedule traveling around the world for his videography. As a result, scheduling a mutually agreeable time was quite difficult. After a brief exchange, I messaged him this:

…Long story short, I had blocked out the incident for some time and several months back I remembered it. It piqued my curiosity so much, I started casually sharing the story with a few skeptical friends who were all 100% confident they could explain it. When I would tell the story, they would all get silent and then without any explanation just declare that they don't believe in the supernatural and that it "must have been a speaker" or "that guy (you) was probably playing a prank on you".

So first of all, I just want to confirm that you did actually hear the "voice" (although you mentioned you could not confirm what it said) and that we did our absolute best to find a natural explanation.

Second, assuming the above is true, you asked me directly afterwards "Josh, were you ever involved in the church in the past?" That question, I'll admit, scared me. Because it was spot on. Can you elaborate on why you asked me that question? I'm taking it that your faith directly led you to that conclusion but I want to not jump to any conclusions.

A few weeks later, my good childhood friend who I will call Jason asked me out for a hang at the famous Stockholm Park Rålambshovsparken. On April 22, 2019 - the day after Easter - we met up in the park on the grass to enjoy the far-too-short sunshine season with a light beer. Throughout the park sun-starved swedes ventured out to sunbathe after being cooped up all winter in darkness. The sky was bright blue with only a few wisps of clouds high up in the atmosphere. Seagulls were screaming their joy, trying to steal every sign of food from the picnicker's blankets. It was a beautiful day.

Jason and I began with the usual work and family conversations. At some point I wanted to bring up some of the spiritual shifts that were occurring in my life but did not know how to broach the topic. We had known each other from about the age of 8 and had a lot of childhood experience together. We were both huge nerds and used to regularly play around with science experiments like the old Radio Shack electronic kits as kids. Jason’s dad was one of the only atheists I knew growing up and was a huge science buff. Additionally, Jason was a successful engineer at Garmin so I knew he was an incredibly rational person. Maybe he could give me some perspective on what was happening to me?

At some point I sheepishly recounted the story about the ghostly voice. As I began to tell the story I felt a strange sensation around me, almost as if I was revealing an embarrassing secret that an invisible force wanted hidden. I did my best to shake this feeling, but it felt like something wanted me to be silent. It was such an odd sensation to have! It felt as if there was a pressure of energy directed toward me to forget this ever happened. I nearly froze and at multiple points felt that finishing sentences was difficult and unnatural. Jason listened intently with an increasingly concerned look on his face.

I finished the story and Jason looked at me intently for a moment and then looked away. I could tell he was struggling to process what he had heard. After an awkward pause, Jason offered the only mildly reasonable explanation I have ever heard: “Maybe Rodney played a prank on you.”

“Maybe…” I replied. “but I doubt it… I am supposed to meet with him this weekend to discuss. I guess I will find out then.”

At this moment, I felt the strange sensation heighten and I tried to ignore it. I plopped my head back in the grass and looked up at the bright blue sky. Was it truly possible that I had an extraordinary unexplainable encounter with a ghost?

As my thoughts trailed off and I stared at the blue emptiness, my eyes alighted on something odd high up in the atmosphere. Birds and some dragonflies buzzed us, and a few airplanes could be seen in the distance, but straight above me was a moving speck. A tiny round silver object, barely visible and yet distinct, was rapidly speeding across the sky, heading northwest.

“Jason, what is that?” I blurted, startled, and pointed straight up.

Jason quickly turned to where I pointed and after a brief search acknowledged he could see it.

“Jason there is another one, look!” I exclaimed, astonished at the appearance of a second object.

Two identical silver objects were now flying at the exact same speed in the exact same direction, not too far from each other. Oh no, not UFOs I thought.

“Should we take a picture?” Jason asked.

“They are too far away… it will just be a blurry blob.” I responded.

We could barely focus our eyes on this object, so trying to zoom a camera would not only be impossible, but it would mean we would have to take our eyes off the object to try to aim the phone at it.

We both looked at each other bewildered. The internal sensation I had been feeling was now at its peak. This was an important moment for reasons I did not yet grasp. Jason mused that it might be a top-secret government project, but I was skeptical. It would be weird for any country to try a top-secret experiment over a main capital city. It was not lost on me that this was happening within a few minutes after I opened about the spiritual realm and had a strange sensation of being watched.

Eventually the objects flew out of sight. As I continued to stare at the sky, I was shocked to see something that allowed me to capture a truly incredible photo:
 
The above photo was taken on April 22, 2019 at 16:33 CET in Stockholm, Sweden.

For a moment, I did not believe my eyes. An airplane gently flew across the sky with a long white contrail. But in front of the airplane against the blue of the sky, all the way to the horizon, lay a dark black line. A non-audible voice spoke softly to my soul: “Josh, this is what your life is like.” Jason and I both looked at that strange sight until the airplane flew out of view.

The idea that large chunks of my life were predetermined was impressed upon me. I was on a path from which I could not divert, just like that airplane was destined to fly through its own shadow. I felt a warm sensation of purpose flow over me but then quickly revolted at the idea that I was - once again – might be receiving some sort of supernatural message in my soul.

The following day, I googled what this dark line could possibly be. What we had seen was a rare but natural phenomenon called a contrail shadow. In an unusual circumstance the atmosphere can have a lower layer of air that contains more humidity than the upper layer but not enough humidity to produce visible clouds. It could be that the upper layer has conditions that enable long contrails from airplanes. If there are no other cloud obstructions and the sun is positioned behind the airplane, the sun might cast a shadow of the airplane’s contrail on the lower humid layer. This is rarely captured on photo because it is virtually impossible to plan for this to happen because all the conditions are entirely dependent on the weather. Naturally, it is even more rare for a person to be on the ground in such a location that the dark shadow lines up perfectly with the contrail.

Because we both had seen those two silver UFO objects, I just so happened to be watching the sky right when this natural phenomenon occurred, snapped the picture, and heard that that small voice speak to my soul.

I was completely unable to find anything to explain what the two silver objects were, however.

# Chapter 33 – Angels in my Apartment

Rodney and I finally managed to schedule a chat on Saturday, April 27. My heart was filled with anticipation for this fateful call, and deep down I hoped that he would lay to rest any paranormal interpretation of the event.

We began our conversation with short pleasantries, and then I asked him what he remembered about the fateful morning at the AirBnB. Without hesitation, Rodney recounted everything. His explanation was identical in every major point to what I remembered.

Then, almost as if compelled, Rodney began passionately impressing upon me that he firmly believed that what I experienced was not only supernatural, but that he had concluded that it was a special message for me. He then - without knowing anything about my prayer long ago - said that he had concluded that the reason he also experienced it was because he “was supposed to be the witness”. I was stunned.

Rodney then tells me that he has known the owner of that London flat for years and he has stayed there countless times, sometimes for more than a month at a time. After my experience there, Rodney went back and spoke at length to the owner about what had happened and other experiences people had had. He reminded me that numerous people have had paranormal “experiences” in that same flat. In fact, the owner’s adult son refused to go into one room in the house because of something that had happened to him as a child.

My heart sunk the more Rodney spoke.

Rodney reminds me of his unwavering faith in Christ and that he is an Episcopalian. “Catholic light”, he called it with a suppressed chuckle. Throughout the call he kept coming back to faith as a pivotal element of his life and the inspiration for his repeated charitable efforts throughout the world. He went into great deal about some of his faith experiences, including his work with the founder of Gore-Tex’s wife. As he recounts, while doing some video work for Gore-Tex, Rodney had a strange private spiritual encounter with this woman where he convinced her of the truth of Christianity right before she passed away.

Then, without any prompting, Rodney began talking about a famous saint in the Catholic Church. Rodney could not even remember this saint’s name at first. Rodney insisted that I read a very specific book about this saint. I was to read a book called Padre Pio: The Stigmatist, by Charles Mortimer Carty. Rodney made it clear to me that he was not Catholic, but I should read this book.

After our two-hour conversation, I committed to reading the book about Padre Pio, thanked Rodney for his time, and ended the call. Alone in my bed, I closed my laptop and stared at the moonlit shadows being cast throughout my tiny living room.

Then, without warning, I felt the sensation of dread and a presence. An unseen but distinctly dark source of hatred enveloped my apartment and directed its eyeless gaze at me. Goosebumps formed across my entire body. I crawled under my covers, terrified. It was back. It knew about my conversation with Rodney, and it was not happy.

I called out to God in my spirit for help as this being enveloped the entire apartment in a bubble of despair. I saw nothing with my eyes, but the presence was so real that I squinted to not see anything out of fear it might materialize.

Then, without any warning I sensed a shift in the room. This was a new feeling I had never experienced. Directly in front of me, at the foot of my bed, I could sense the presence of a pure white being. A being that was in intent and energy the antithesis of this demon. It started small and rose up and expanded until it was nearly 3 meters tall and stood firmly between me and this evil thing. And then, in something I still do not comprehend, it split into two. One “white” being went to my entrance which was on the right and the other floated to my exterior balcony which was on the left.

What in the world is going on? I desperately begged in my spirit.

“Josh, you need this protection.” a clear yet inaudible voice responded to my soul.

Protection from what? I pleaded internally, still uncertain as to what this thing was.

There was no response, just a calm silence and the feeling some supernatural guards were stationed at my apartment.

Their presence was so pure it filled me with shame and a new type of fear. I did not know the presence of a being could make a person feel this way. I knew, without being told, that these two beings knew my every thought, my every deed, and my every desire - good and evil. They knew all things about me. Despite my faithlessness, they were now assigned to protect me from this demonic thing. And their light, a type of light which the eyes cannot see but the spirit can, was radiating outward from my apartment like a beacon indicating I was now under guard.

The dark being was gone. Also gone were the fear of death and the goosebumps. I knew this demonic thing still desired to destroy me, but now its effect on my soul was muted. At least for now.

My thoughts drifted to my life decisions, and I began to feel a humiliation I did not know possible. You know when you leave the house and come home, and you see your dog walking with its head down and its tail between its legs? The dog knows it did something bad and that you will find out and that it has no excuse. Your dog has created a mess that only you can clean up. This is how I felt. I felt the purest shame and helplessness. The dog knows you are smarter, wiser, and superior in every way. This is how I felt. I deserved to be left alone with that demonic thing and whatever hell it wanted to drag me off to, because I helped create this mess. But I was being guarded instead.

As I cowered in this stew of confusion, holy fear, humiliation and relief, a thought occurred to me. In the last couple years there were increasing points in my life where it seemed I was given only one obvious direction to go. And each of these moments were like breadcrumbs leading to now. When my acquaintance forgot that I was coming to London, I was forced to change my plans last minute. When I arrived in London and Hailey said she was busy, I was forced to find an Airbnb. When Hailey said I could not stay at her place the fourth night, she was the one who suggested I return to the exact same Airbnb. When I heard the ghostly voice in the shower, the only natural next thing to do was to talk to the only person present: Rodney. When I told Jason the ghostly story, I lay back in the grass and my eyes just happened to catch the silver orbs in the sky. Seeing those orbs inclined me to watch the sky and capture that photo of the contrail shadow, where I heard that voice strongly implying portions of my life were predetermined. And now, at the end of my call with Rodney, he – for reasons that made no sense to me – gave me only one task. That task was to read this very particular book about Padre Pio. This was the only logical next thing to do. Destiny from Providence must lie in these moments. I bought the book for my Kindle, and I committed to reading it.

# Chapter 34 – Testing the Spiritual

The following weeks, I felt daily the presence of these angelic beings. As mentioned, this was an entirely new sensation. I did not sense that these angels had a fixed physical size or location. By all accounts, spiritual beings can move through physical objects, but I had never put thought into how spiritual beings that exist in other dimensions might interact with ours. Do they choose with each apparition how they will appear to our consciousness? I never saw them with my physical eyes, unless the silver objects in the sky were the same beings. If spiritual beings can morph their appearance, how could I possibly know?

But the battle between darkness and light within my spirit was so strong I could not ignore it. Some form of demonic being or beings was still “attacking” me. The attacks often came in the form of extremely vulgar thoughts and voices within my head and an unexplainable dark heaviness. The experience was so intense at times it made me nauseous. A year before, as an atheist, I regularly heard what I assumed was my own internal critical voice, telling me I was worthless or a failure or just needed to try harder. This no longer happened. The mask was off. It appeared that now that I knew that there were spiritual beings out there, I now heard an internal cacophony of voices that were not my own snarling hateful things at me. “You bitch.” “We had you.” “You were ours.” “We will kill you!” “God will never save you!” I remember thinking wait a minute, who is we? The use of first person was so jarring at one point it nearly made me laugh, because this did not feel like something that could just be from my own imagination. I cannot describe the depth of hatred and vulgarity of these voices.

I was assailed by strange temptations as well. One day I purchased some lamb and was preparing it on my cutting board. The packaging had a significant amount of blood in the plastic. Just as I stretched to pour it out, a witchy, salacious, and lustful internal voice spoke to my mind. “Drink the blood.” It startled me so much, I nearly laughed and stopped what I was doing. The voice was so convincing in its tone! It occurred to me that if I was uneducated about witchcraft or science and I had the same voice yell at me to drink blood I might do it! Was this the type of thing that happened to ancient civilizations that ended up performing horrid rituals and human sacrifices? Of course, I did not comply.

Experiences like these drove me into thinking extensively about what spiritual beings must be and what they must want. Do they have a real shape or form, or can they just morph into whatever shape and form they want in our conscious eye? Can they inject themselves into our dreams? How do they travel from one place to another, or can they just materialize in any place in the physical realm that they want? How do they put thoughts into our heads, and is this a mechanism that could be performed with the right equipment? Is this something we can do ourselves? And why in the world do they interact with us at all?

But most concerningly for me, if a being is capable of shapeshifting into anything it wants, how can we trust any of them? After all, if the devil “masquerades as an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14), how can we possibly know which “revelations” are trustworthy? It was true I felt I had some angelic beings guarding me, maybe that is just what they wanted me to think. Maybe the beings causing the good feelings were the bad guys, or even worse, maybe the demonic being saw I was not buying its tricks anymore and decided to morph into angelic beings to retain my attention! If devilish beings can make themselves appear good, maybe all the Biblical authors were deceived too! How could I possibly know who or what to trust? My mind was already flooded with endless contradictions in the Bible, so maybe none of it was trustworthy? Maybe all spiritual beings and experiences are deceptive, and we cannot trust any of them! I was not going to commit to any particular belief until I knew what I was dealing with. I needed more data before I could make any decisions.

But as I gathered data from stories of others who had experienced the supernatural or paranormal, how could I possibly know which pieces of data might be true? First, I needed a litmus test to evaluate the content of the claims of experiencers. I remembered a thought experiment I did as a kid, where I tried to figure out how you could tell if you were in a dream. Could we use a similar thought experiment about religious experiences?

The conclusion I came to as a kid is that you can know if you were in a dream if the contents of the dream were pulled from things you had learned through your senses. If information during an experience is attained that could not have been received through your sensory experience, then that information was received from an unidentified external source.

For example, imagine you have a dream where you are in a storm and wake up to the sound of thunder outside. A dream about a storm is not new information. Your ears picked up sensory information about thunder while your mind was forming a dream. But what if you have a dream that your cousin is in a car crash on I-35 involving a red corvette. You wake up in a cold sweat and it is 3am. An hour later you get a phone call from a family member explaining that every detail in your dream happened. If this happened, there are only two possibilities I can think of. The first is that something unbelievably statistically improbable happened to you, which is quite absurd. The second is that you received information from an external source about a real event in the physical world. We call these events premonitions, synchronicities or prophecies. If specific information received during an “experience” describes things in the physical world without any possibility the person received the information through their normal senses, we can safely surmise that information was received from an external source. This became my first litmus test for paranormal stories.

Imagine a person high on psilocybin claiming that a being is appearing to them and revealing special knowledge. Regardless of the use of drugs, it is still possible they are talking to a real being! In order to perform the test, we would need to take meticulous notes about what is revealed, evaluate its probability and then test it against reality.

You may have heard of ergot fungus and St. Aaron’s Fire. These is the mental hallucinations that might occur when someone ingests ergot-contaminated grain. This occurred often enough in the middle ages when preservation of food was poor. This fungus can cause the mind to hallucinate, but the visions produced are not new information being added to the person’s mind. Instead, the imagination is simply working with information the person already has received. A person under influence of a drug like this will not produce new information about the real world. As a result, the above litmus test works quite well to rule the experiences of those who may have even accidentally become high.

My second litmus test is used to assess poltergeist activity. If a person observes an unseen force affecting physical objects with intelligence and can demonstrate that no known natural force could cause the same physical event, then that is most likely caused by a non-physical external being. What I mean by “with intelligence” is that the physical effect produced would have required education or a tool to achieve. For example, if an unseen force unlocks a door and opens and closes it and then locks it again, we can safely conclude this is a real paranormal or supernatural event. But hearing a single bump in the night does not pass this test. The former requires intelligence and a tool the latter does not.

And finally, the third set of litmus tests are nothing special to the paranormal or supernatural. We just need to eliminate liars, so we need some guidance in that. If two socially disconnected people describe the same experience and stand to gain nothing from it, then they are most likely telling the truth (e.g. Rodney and myself). If a person tells of their experience despite risking status, money, or family because of their telling, then they are most likely telling the truth. If a person demonstrates a track-record of deceptive behavior, it is far more believable that they would deceive than that their account of a paranormal experience is real. However, if a historically honest person suddenly has a paranormal experience and it takes great effort to pull the story from them, then they are most likely telling the truth. Finally, you can often tell the truthfulness of these stories by how a person expresses emotion during the telling. In my experience, people who have spontaneous and uncontrollable awkward emotional reactions while telling their story are most likely telling the truth. For a liar, it is the missing emotions that speak truth. For a truthteller, it is the uncontrolled emotions that confirm their honesty. In short, you must weigh the motives and emotional reactions of an experiencer. 

It is worth mentioning that at first, I was trying to find stories I could trust did happen. I was far less interested in whether some message communicated through the experience was true. Just because a person does tell the truth about their experience does not mean that the contents of the message they received are the truth.

In my research, I used these three litmus tests to sift out the vast majority of paranormal or supernatural experiences I came across. While I did not make a comprehensive list, I estimate that less than 2% of the stories I researched passed all the above tests. However, a couple stories stood out prominently.

There was a young woman around 2019 who had a YouTube channel about beauty and makeup with dozens of videos reviewing beauty products. I discovered one of her videos because one day this young woman posted a video where she was describing her ghost experiences as a child in a house that her parents purchased. Apparently, she casually mentioned something about ghosts in one of her makeup videos and people harassed her in the comments to tell the entire story, so she reluctantly agreed. In her video, she said that as a child she would wake up at night and their dog would be growling at something in the hall. More than once, if her door was open, she would see a dark, translucent shadow creep down the hall toward her parents' room. She, and the dog, were obviously startled and terrified.

One night, she was in bed and felt something staring at her in her room. This “being” then proceeds to sit down on her bed and she could feel the weight of her sheets and covers press down. Terrified, she screamed. Immediately, her sheets and blanket leapt off her bed, flew across the room and landed on top of a TV. Her dad heard the scream, woke up, and burst into her room to see her huddled on her bed completely terrified.

The next day, her family had a meeting, and her parents admitted they had been experiencing things as well but did not want to talk about it because they thought it was going to scare her and her sister. Because their children were now being affected, they decided to move to a new house and their family never had any experiences like that again. Based on her timeline, this story would have occurred in the early 2000s.

For my part, I already believed the idea of feeling a presence in the room. I had experienced this many times, but in my experiences, there was never a poltergeist. If this did happen, it certainly was not only in her head!

Around this same time, I was reading the memoire of the famous psychotherapist Carl Jung . To my surprise, Carl Jung had numerous paranormal experiences. One of the stories recorded in his memoir is that of his daughter being woken up in the night terrified and her sheets and blanket being thrown across the room by an unseen force. Best I could calculate, this incident would have happened around 1950.

How was it possible that fifty years apart, two separate individuals - a world-renowned psychotherapist and a young makeup artist - recounted the exact same type of paranormal experience with bedsheets being flung across the room by an invisible being? I was quite certain this young makeup artist had never read Carl Jung’s story. It was impossible that Carl Jung’s story was influenced by the girl. Neither one of them stood to gain status or money from telling their respective stories. It was deeply improbable that Carl Jung and this young makeup artist were influenced to invent nearly identical stories. In conclusion, they both were likely telling the truth.

As I read further, Jung described a pivotal fight with Sigmund Freud over how to handle spiritual experiences in their therapy. Freud insisted that they should be ignored in treating patients, while Jung insisted that they should be included. Early in the field of psychology, religious dreams and visions and the like were studied. Carl Jung was an advocate of continuing this practice. Freud wanted to ignore them. Freud, for the most part, won this battle. Given my knowledge of modern psychology, I found it incredible that a founder of the field as scholarly as Carl Jung was describing paranormal experiences without reservation.

This got me thinking about how often humans historically made decisions based on dreams, visions, and paranormal events. Throughout most of human history, leaders of large tribes of people would make nation-altering decisions based on information by paranormal means. Large chunks of human culture were established through paranormal experiences. Think about Judaism, which was a seed of religious stories that fanned out into the world’s main religions. That cultural foundation began with stories like Abraham receiving promises directly from God and Jacob wrestling with an angel of God. One of the longest standing religious feasts in the world is the Passover Feast, where each element of food is a symbol representing an element of the Hebrew’s divine rescue from slavery. How did that feast come to exist, if something extraordinary had not happened? How could anyone convince an entire nation to start a feast with food representing events that never happened without major pushback ? Every ancient nation had dream interpreters and seers. And leaders did not use their guidance to make small decisions, but they often made decisions that affected entire nations and the future of thousands of people. If some non-terrestrial beings wanted to influence human evolution or history without scaring us half to death, dreams and visions and paranormal events would be a great way to do it.

Curiously, most educated people in the west pride themselves on ignoring the content of dreams and visions. We see ourselves as rational and treat dreams as if they are just random thoughts. To be fair, most dreams are benign, and great harm has come from misinterpreting dreams and visions! Consider the horror stories of cults (including mass suicide). Tragedies like these often start with a stark-raving mad lunatic and his or her visions or dreams. If paranormal information sources are always chaotic, then why, for thousands of years of human history were we not as resistant to the idea that the position of seers or prophets was essential?

Unfortunately for me, this deluge of supernatural stories felt about as useful as reading cow livers. So many of the paranormal stories that passed my tests did not deliver any information about what I was supposed to believe or do with my life. Many of the believable stories contradicted each other in their content. Some were about aliens, others about Catholicism, and yet others were strange encounters that appeared to have no connection to any religion at all. I urgently need to build a cohesive narrative about the world given what I was experiencing. This war between some angelic and demonic beings around me was beginning to affect my health and morale.

Despite reviewing hundreds and hundreds of stories, I failed to construct a solid theory of what, exactly, was happening to me. The paranormal stories I was reading were all over the map. I quickly deduced that I needed at least one trustworthy external being guiding me to the truth. I could not satisfy my soul with information. I needed spiritual guidance. My only hope was that an external spiritual being step in and continue to guide me in the right direction.

# Chapter 35 – Rabid Dog on a Chain

At this time two breadcrumbs were providentially placed in front of me. The first was inexplicable. Two exceptionally fast gleaming silver objects high in the sky had grabbed the attention of my friend and I, and we did not know what they were. This answer would come in time. But the second breadcrumb was that Rodney recommended the book The Stigmatist. This was the only thing Rodney suggested I do next. Despite growing up anti-Catholic, I began reading it with heavy reservations.

The entire thing was uncomfortable for me to read. Anti-Catholic arguments from my youth bubbled up within me. The book recounts miracles that were done through Padre Pio and years before on I developed an aversion to anything that could be deemed “pentecostal”. I found myself wanting to argue with every story in the text. My atheist mind still wanted to debunk everything. This Catholic who supposedly had the wounds of Christ in his hands and was bilocating was a bridge too far. I read it anyway, feeling that this is what Providence clearly wanted me to do.

Thankfully, the story became quite interesting when I swallowed my pride. Francesco Fiorione was born in the small town of Pietrelcina, Italy on the 25th of May, 1887. By all reports he was extraordinarily spiritually gifted. From a young age he began experiencing demonic attacks and had a conscience that was more sensitive than everyone around him. This part grabbed my interest.

Early on, Pio felt a call into ministry, and in time felt led to become a Catholic Priest. Strange visions, dreams, and synchronicities enveloped his life, and as his commitment to Christ grew, his unusual spiritual gifting followed suit. At the age of 23, he was ordained a priest and henceforth became known as Padre Pio.

One day, during a time of devotion and prayer, Pio had a terrifying but enrapturing experience that left him with open wounds in his hands, his feet, and his side. He claimed the experience related directly to God, his guardian angels, and the devil. He saw it as his way of participating in the work of Christ. The wounds were positioned so that they resembled the gouges that Christ had received on the cross from the nails and from the spear that pierced his side. Skepticism welled up within me. The claim was that these wounds would continue to openly bleed in varying measure until his death. This was apparently validated by perplexed doctors. If true, the symbolism was astounding! The Catholic faithful saw Padre Pio as a participant in the sufferings of Jesus and the wounds were a sign that God has marked Padre Pio as a special messenger to the world.

Even Catholic leaders were perplexed! Pio was not your standard Catholic. As time progressed, People claimed he performed healings or that some were just healed by being associated with him or by following his commands. People claimed he was bilocating, that he had appeared in people’s dreams, and that he was given the gift to divine the intentions and hidden sins of parishioners at his parish. His devotees increased, despite the fact he appeared to have no desire for accolades and shunned the limelight.

Many skeptics fought against him and claimed he was a charlatan, including some high in the ranks of the Church. Padre Pio, through it all, was resolute and humble, serving his small church parish as he felt led.

As I read on, I was surprised that I warmed quite a bit to the man. At the beginning my skeptical mind was tearing apart and judging the story, but by the end I had calmed down enough to think that perhaps Padre Pio did not intend to deceive anyone. The evidence seemed to be that he was truly a saint marked by God.

Then, as I neared the end of the book, my entire soul flooded with emotions at this short quote from Pio:

“The devil is like a rabid dog tied to a chain; beyond the length of the chain he cannot seize anyone. And you: keep at a distance. If you approach too near, you let yourself be caught. Remember that the devil has only one door by which to enter the soul: the will.”

My mind raced back to nearly twenty years before, when I fought depression and demonic thoughts and an unrelenting fear of sin and hell. That weight of depression and dark thoughts had pushed me to consider suicide. And then I had that dream, the one dream that had given me hope. The memory of it had never left me. 

I was floating amid a dark void, alone, unseen, and unconsidered. An angry wolf, its mouth the size of my body, had lunged at me out of the darkness. My soul flooded with fear of impending death. As fresh as if the dream had happened yesterday, I could still hear the clink as the wolf reached the end of its chain. Then as I awoke, there had been that inaudible voice: “Josh it does not matter how far the devil goes, he is always on a chain.” 

That dream had to have been from God! I did not even know who Padre Pio was until years after I had the dream! God must have known the future, and He had planted that dream in my sleep. He must have known that I would become an atheist, that I would run away, and that I would reach some point in the future where everything would come to a climax. I let a devil take over my life as an atheist, deceived into thinking I was escaping pain and trauma, but then selfishly pursuing what I wanted in the world. And God knew it all, and He loved me anyway. He loved me enough to turn the entire thing into a story that drove me to tears.

Through tears of joy and relief, I recalled the photo of the airplane flying through its contrail shadow. “Josh, this is what your life is like”, another inaudible voice had said. My life must be a series of predefined events that were out of my control. I had given my life fully to God as a child, and He listened. Every vestige of the suffering I had endured now had purpose. Even when I was running away from faith, I was still in the plan. God had allowed the devil to go only so far in my life, and then he planned to rescue me.

As a teen without any access to anything Catholic, God had seen fit to give me a dream that was a direct quote from a Catholic priest who died in the 1960s. Somehow, God had known I would fall away into atheism and move halfway across the world before I would reach the end of my rope. Perhaps God heard my wild prayer saying that I was “willing to become an atheist” and made a deal with the devil. I do not know! God knew that I would ask for a particular sign to prove His existence, and He – or some angels – also set in motion a series of events that led to that ghostly moment in that AirBnB. He positioned Rodney at the same AirBnB to be the witness while answering my prayer. God had known that Rodney - a photographer by trade - would get involved in a computer science video project that would perk my interest and cause me to add him on LinkedIn. The voice that occurred twice in that apartment was the gentle but perplexing answer to my prayer for proof of the supernatural. One year after the ghostly voice and meeting Rodney, God knew I would start to turn back to Him and would reach out to Rodney to talk. And God knew that Rodney would recommend one specific book about Padre Pio that would have that quote from my dream.

Now I knew that a Hand was guiding me the entire time, and all I needed to do was reach out and humble myself a bit and grab it. All I had to do was be honest about my failures, my selfishness, and my complete ignorance of the spiritual, and God and his angels were apparently right there all along to deliver me.

# Chapter 36 – Who to trust?

Some of you are probably furrowing your eyebrows with deep skepticism at this point. It may relieve many of you that shortly after this moment I as well reverted to skepticism. The religious experiences were wonderful, but I would waffle between religious purpose and joy to a flood of atheist and naturalistic arguments. I was still not certain I could trust what I was experiencing. But the supernatural events were only getting started, and my mind was racing to unravel what was occurring to me.

In Chapter 34, I discussed testing the spiritual. My own testing of various experiences had confirmed that something akin to a “spiritual realm” must exist. I could not see any way to interpret the entire series of events described to this point as anything less than a direct answer from something in the spiritual realm to my prayers. But my studies as an atheist and an amateur scientist and theologian had armed my mind with intellectual arguments against nearly every doctrine in Christianity. The experiences may have been real, but could I trust them?

I knew that at least some of the claims in Christianity must be true. Some interdimensional beings are communicating with humanity. After all, the synchronicity of the dream matching Pio’s quote defied probability because I did not know about Pio when I had the dream. I knew for sure that some beings were pointing toward Padre Pio, and Padre Pio was without any doubt pointing toward Jesus. But I was not ready to fully accept the gospel – good news – of the death and resurrection of Jesus without further proof. Everything was so utterly strange.

It felt incredible to believe that something appeared to have orchestrated my life events. Something wanted me to believe in Christ. For many people this would have been enough, but I was still unsure, scarred by years of church neglect and abuse and stories of conflicting religious experiences. My intellect had become my safety to hide from my emotional wounds. And my intellect, having spent year after year building up defensive and debunking skills, found serious problems with what I was experiencing.

At this time, I was regularly praying. I was blunt and unabashed, telling God what I really thought about everything. God, I am sorry for this, but here is why I thought the way I did. God, I think this idea the church has traditionally taught is stupid, but I am open to being shown otherwise. God, please protect me and show me where the devil is working. God, I do not trust any of my senses or the experiences fully. God, why in the world is sexual promiscuity wrong when it is so wrong and we have contraception? God, why are there so many contradictions in the Bible texts? God, which church is right, because they all appear to have doctrines that are full of holes? My questions were endless and to my frustration most of them were met with silence. Were my prayers lacking respect? Did my years as an atheist corrupt my mind so much that my internal intentions were all eschew?

The one prayer that I felt I could trust was the Lord’s Prayer. Jesus had put his stamp of approval on it, and so I just trusted that was a good starting point. In every moment where I just did not know what to pray, I would pray the Lord’s prayer:

Our Father, who is in heaven, hallowed by your name
Your kingdom come, your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our debts as we forgive those indebted to us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from the evil one

The collection of synchronicities I was experiencing seemed to fly in the face of any rigid doctrine. I was unwilling to commit to any denominational viewpoint – including Roman Catholicism.  I was taught that any revelations from Catholics were probably demonic. I had also concluded that numerous Catholic doctrines are contradicted by scripture texts. But why then had God given me a prophetic dream that gave a positive nod toward a Catholic priest?

I waffled between anger and resignation toward God for pulling me back into theological quagmires. My mental model was so much easier as an atheist!

One problem stood out above all others. If a devil is powerful enough to perform miracles, then it can pretend to be God. If a devil can pretend to be from God, what test can we use to distinguish between a malevolent demon’s revelations and those that are from the good God? Maybe every religious experience is a lie? This is, genuinely, the greatest doubt I have ever had since these experiences began.

I wrestled with and prayed about this question endlessly. My own experiences were real, but how could I know they could be trusted? Maybe a being was toying with me and playing good cop, then bad cop. Maybe both the good feelings of joy and peace and the bad feelings of despair and doom are tricks from the same bag! Maybe some alien being was using me as a pawn to push people back into Christianity because humanity was getting too close to an edge. How could I possibly know?

A thought exercise occurred – or was given – to me that helped me resolve part of this riddle. I knew that good feelings like joy and peace exist. It would be reasonable to conclude that at least some spiritual beings can experience these feelings as well. Honesty and truth also exist, at least in part. I had experienced some beings pushing me toward suicide, and I knew from how awful I felt internally that they were dead serious that I should go through with it. It appeared that some beings, like a psychotic serial killer, just enjoy our human sufferings. If the highest and most powerful being is an evil, psychotic being that loves deception and causing suffering, why would good things happen at all? Why not just turn earth into hell right now and maximize the suffering of mankind? There must be at least one spiritual being that opposes this end. And that being must be the most powerful one. So, it stands to reason that regardless of how much evil appears to have the upper hand, there must be at least one good being out there holding back complete torment. That good being is the one that I wanted.

But if human experience is flooded with deceptive and contradictory religious experiences, how can we know which experiences are from which being?

Here is a riddle. Imagine you are trapped in a magical forest. The creator of the forest built a magical golden door into the side of a tree that leads to escape. But evil elves have taken over the forest and want to trap you. They fashion fake golden doors on every tree! If you go through the wrong golden door, you will be trapped forever. How can you possibly know which golden door is the right one?

I was stuck. I did not want to try any door for fear it was the wrong one.

God! Help me! I have proof that a spiritual realm exists, but which way should I go?

# Chapter 37 – Narrow Door

As the summer of 2019 progressed, reasoning was forming in my mind that was shining light through the lies. I began to see ways that one could find a way through the deceptive religious experiences.

For deception to exist, there must be a truth that is concealed. After all, a being only deceives when they are trying to distract from the truth. Once a being has full power over its prey, it no longer needs to engage in deception. It can take off its mask and devour. As long as you know someone is trying to deceive you, you have a clue that you are still capable of ascertaining the truth and finding an escape.

The louder a liar screams, the more they must be afraid you are close to the truth. If malevolent spirits exist and desire our pure suffering, then the fact that we are not always suffering is some evidence that there must be a good being holding them back. And if this good being can hold the bad ones at bay, then it would imply that the good being is more powerful than the bad ones. What Padre Pio had said about the devil being like a rabid dog held by a chain was logically deducible. If any amount of good things continue to happen, then we can conclude there must be both good and bad beings, and that the good beings are more powerful, at least to some extent.

One will ask why the good beings, if they are more powerful, do not just step in and subdue the bad beings entirely. I was stumped for quite some time on this, until I realized that there might be good reasons why they would not do this. I had once realized that spiritual beings might have good reasons for hiding themselves, and this caused me to pray that prayer for proof of their existence. Now I realized they existed, and I realized they might have good reasons for not just annihilating evil outright.

Imagine you wanted to create beings with free will and wanted to determine if those beings loved the good or loved evil. How could you set them in an environment where they could prove their devotion to evil or to good? Evil beings deceive, and so naturally you cannot just trust what they say they love, you must put them to a test where they prove they love the good. You could provide rewards and punishment, but even this will not work. If you just set up a list of rules to follow, selfish and evil people will follow the rules just to get the reward, not because they genuinely love the good. The only way you can know if a being truly loves the good is if they pursue the good even when they are not sure there is a reward. They must genuinely believe they may be all alone and that nobody sees them and that they may never receive a reward and do the right thing anyway. This being has proven they love the good .

So then, you would need to create an environment, place the beings in it, and provide real, tangible ways in which they will feel abandoned and can choose to be evil. You would need to hide or at the very least subdue their knowledge about how they were being tested. You know how parents will sometimes secretly observe their kid’s behavior to see what their kids do? The kid thinks they are completely alone. The parent wants to see what the kids do when they think they will not get caught. What if our existence on earth is like this? God and angels intentionally hide their presence, so that we think we are utterly alone, and then they observe whether we are pursuing the good or not. This could explain why God does not step in and just stop all the evil, because to do so would be giving up the game. God gives the devil just enough chain to convince evil people they will get away with it. And God limits the chain of the devil for those who do not want to pursue evil. This is why Jesus cried “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” To fully pass the test of being human, He had to reach a point of abandonment and still choose to do the good.

Let us return to our analogy in the previous chapter of the entrapping forest with the Golden Door. If a Good Being knows that the forest is a trap and has the goodwill to create a Golden Door to help you escape, then that same Good Being must also know that evil elves will create fake golden doors. The entire motive of the evil elves is to keep you from going through the real door. They will use every trick or treat to get you to go through any one of the fake doors. A sign that you are near a fake door is if the evil elves are quiet, giddy, delighted, or encouraging you to go through that specific door. The evil elves will not care what method gets you to go through the fake one - insults or praise or delicious distractions. But notice the golden door the evil elves want you to stay away from the most! Due to there being a plethora of fake doors and only one right door, the Good Voice will be the one that says No far more often than it says Yes. The evil voices are the ones that say Yes to nearly everything except One Door.

If human experience is full of demonic beings trying to hide truth, then it would stand to reason that when the spiritual voices are only about peace and love and achieving what makes you satisfied – even if it is within religious belief itself! – then you are going through a fake door. Evil beings scream, cause distractions, send new temptations, and take away all fun when you are starting to go the right direction. If you have never had any spirits do these things, chances are you are near the wrong door.

Clearly, I had been – or was even now – being deceived by some spiritual beings. This was undeniable. I had been deceived into believing that no spiritual beings exist and then had been driven to a point of near suicide by these same beings. Malevolent spiritual beings saw my death as a positive. Why else would so many people be pushed to suicide by voices in their head? What kind of beings both would want to hide their existence and simultaneously push humans to despair and death?

On the flipside, I was now daily experiencing what felt like the presence of good beings that overrode these negative voices. Rather than hearing voices pressing me to drink ,party, sleep around, and focus on myself and that I was either a useless piece of garbage or some misunderstood genius, I was now experiencing soft and gentle voices encouraging me to be healthy, to drink less, to stop consuming pornography, to avoid manipulative people, to love my neighbor, and to get good sleep and take care of myself. The more I listened to the gentle voices encouraging me to gain control over my lust, impatience, and selfishness, the louder and more obnoxious and brazen the dark voices were screaming.

I was staring right at the magical golden door.

# Chapter 38 – Conscience

When I originally prayed asking for evidence of the supernatural, what I hoped would happen was that after a divine proof, God or some being would supernaturally direct me to an outline detailing the correct things to believe about the universe. I had been led to believe that if your factual understanding of the universe was accurate then this would bring fulfillment and peace. If I was given what I wanted, I would be able to sit down and map out the origin of the universe, of life, of mankind, and of the various species of angels and demons and whatever other creatures may exist. I could organize a perfect moral system for every situation and explain all the weird Bible passages and paranormal events in the world.

Instead, God first answered my prayer by providing some form of spiritual protection. The undeniable implication was that we humans are incapable of defending ourselves from our primary enemy. All of us are very important and our souls are in extreme danger.

God and angelic intervention then shifted to providing moral direction. It felt like a cleaning company from heaven walked me into the messiest room in my soul, had thrown open the door, and gently was pointing out the mess. My conscience was awake. I did not enjoy it at all.

I was still partying, getting drunk and sleeping around. I was aware that the activities I was engaging in were traditionally considered sinful, but I rationalized every lust and excess. For years, I put herculean effort into crafting a version of myself that discarded my antiquated Christian past. My social life revolved around people and events that involved alcohol and unjudgmental indulgence. At this point I did not know a single person in my friend group in Sweden who was not okay with hedonism if “nobody is getting hurt”. They all had no moral qualms with watching pornography, sex with as many partners as you want, homosexuality, drunkenness, or drug use. Most of them were okay with abortion, lying, cheating, and light theft if they could convince themselves in some way that it was not hurting people too much.

But, with new eyes I was starting to see my own actions as foolish, chaotic, and selfish. Where I used to tell myself that I was sleeping around to “find” the right person, I realized I usually knew from the beginning that the woman was a bad fit. While I took pride in my own honesty, I started to see that I would often hide my true motives. And as God was throwing light on the dingy dark room of my soul, I saw that my urges binge drink, smoke, and introduce chaos into my life were a desperate attempt to avoid the anxiety and emptiness my decisions were creating. I did not want to sit still and gaze at the emptiness in my soul, because it would only make ashamed and guilty.

Shame and guilt can be good. Many people say, “you should live with no regrets” or “every mistake you make is a learning experience.” I now saw that this was usually an excuse to do things a person knows are bad. This philosophy ignores the lessons we can learn from the behavior of others. It can encourage people to ignore moral wisdom from the past and our elders. It downplays morality by treating all actions as “finding yourself”. It also assumes that we cannot teach others because others need to make the mistakes themselves. This philosophy lies and implies that cheating with a coworker is a similar “experience” to being committed to your wife. Shame exists for a reason, and some actions are more shameful than others. A healthy sense of shame and guilt comes from the awareness at how you have spread pain and chaos into the world, and it should pressure you to both not repeat your bad behavior and to warn others not to do the same thing.

Yes, people can warp morality and thereby turn shame into something toxic. These people self-righteously flaunt their expertise at following this warped moral system and shame everyone else from their perch. They find ways to use rules to selfishly bring themselves money or fame at the expense of others. The same that comes from these types of systems is not the good type of shame and guilt that I was experiencing. What I experienced was that my eyes were now opened to how much pain and trouble my own decisions and attitudes were causing in the world, and I recognition that if everyone in the world lived to fulfill their own lusts, rather than sacrificing in love for others, society would be destroyed.

Because of warped morals, we who championed an open lifestyle “without regrets” regularly experienced toxic shame and regret about the wrong things. The shame we expressed was not about immoral behavior like cheating, lying, drunken escapades, or manipulating others. Instead we expressed shame about superficial things like gaining weight, career choices, who we hung out with, status, or how we looked in photos. How depraved are we when we are encouraged to feel shame when we skip the gym but are told it was just a “learning experience” to cheat on your husband? Then, while we are out selfishly using others for our lust, we can feel self-righteous about our behavior if we can show they are helping the environment, championing some social cause, or opposing whatever ideology is popular to hate! Jesus condemned these public displays of righteousness vehemently, and on many occasions said that this behavior was worse than being a prostitute or outright thief. What if we avoided both selfish hedonism and self-righteousness?

God was shining fresh sunlight on the spiritual garbage in my soul’s basement, and the devil was right there trying to pull my attention away. Little voices were hounding me on a minute-by-minute basis. The voices were telling me I would never be good enough so why bother trying to be good? They said that I was a bad Christian, so why not just continue in my current behavior? The world is so flooded with evil people, just join in a little bit! Voices whispered that I would never figure out the truth about the universe and the spiritual realm, so why not give up? And then these voices would flip in an instant and tell me that I was such an amazing person in Gods eyes and He loved me so much that I did not need to change, so why not just continue in the same behavior? You are smart and successful, you are right on the edge of making it in life, just focus on your career and becoming rich! Look around, Josh, other people are happy and getting away with their behavior, cheating, and lies so why are you worried about your own behavior? God is just going to turn your existence into a boring, sexless, bleary hell on earth. If I stopped sinning, I was miserable with deprivation, and if I kept sinning, I was miserable with shame and guilt.

The rapid way in which the voices would switch from extreme shaming of me to praising me was insane. This experience genuinely gave me pause to wonder if most forms of bipolar disorder are not just demonic oppressors playing good cop/bad cop to keep a person ensnared in their ways. These voices made it incredibly difficult to distinguish between what God was telling me and what was demonic. I know this was one goal of the assault.

I started to ascertain the tactics through the mental fog. During war, one tactic is to impersonate the enemies’ leaders. If you hack the transmission lines and simulate the enemies’ communications, you can pretend to be the enemy and give orders and hope someone falls for it. You could also just flood every line of communication with garbage so that it is extremely hard for the enemy to sift through the mess to find the truth. This was what I started to feel was happening to me on a spiritual level. Likewise, Padre Pio said during his worst attacks the devil would alternate from appearing as a naked woman to appearing as saints or even Jesus. These information warfare tactics seem to be in heavy use by our spiritual enemy, and during this period I was experiencing these types of attacks daily. Overall, I knew I was protected from the worst of it, but these voices made it incredibly difficult to hear what heaven was saying.

The big things had to go first. Drunkenness, pornography, and sleeping around were probably the biggest vices in my life. I started to feel convicted about my behavior and stubbornly tried to rationalize it for months. Sexual relationships are just a normal part of the animal kingdom, I would tell myself, and marriage is just an invention to help with social cohesion. As long as two people are just enjoying each other and were honest about their intentions, why did God or angels care at all about what we did with our bodies? God provided clear signs to me that both sleeping around, and pornography were wrong. The devil had a stronghold in this part of my life, and he would not let go easily.

As I began to resist temptation, I noticed that what I had once considered just “bad luck” or “being incompatible” in dating now appeared to be spiritually coordinated. Repeatedly, the devil knew my sexual preferences and was pushing women toward me. I became keenly aware that sexual relationships are not just between two people who are deciding something to do for fun and pleasure. A rendezvous can be set up in the spiritual realm for serious harm. One example stood out above all others.

After Spotify I got a job at a tiny start-up, and I also helped get a colleague of mine from Spotify hired. We were the two primary software engineers at this new company.

One day, my colleague introduced me to his who was accompanied by his attractive girlfriend. I felt instant lust but did my best to ignore it. Jeff was excited to talk to both of us because he was newer to software engineering, and I offered to maybe help get him a job at Spotify via referral because I still had connections. As we chatted, I was surprised to learn that both Justin and his girlfriend lived in my apartment complex. I had lived there for nearly two years and never seen them. They said they had been living there for quite some time but would be moving soon. What a strange coincidence that I had never seen them!

A few days later, I look out my window and my eyes fall on his girlfriend walking around their now empty apartment naked with their curtains wide open. I stared in shock. Their apartment was literally right across the courtyard from mine. What is the probability I had never seen this couple in two years, I meet them and am attracted to this girl, and a few days later I look out my window right as she is walking around naked?

Josh, I can set this up - a salacious voice whispered in my head. You are the more successful man, and she knows it. Set up a meeting over beers with him with the pretext to “talk about work” and casually mention if his girlfriend wants to come, she should come too...

A cohesive plan was laid out before me on how I could sleep with this woman. Bathsheba could be mine! I can still feel the sick weight of pleasure in this offer nearly five years later. I felt overwhelmed and almost nauseous with the allure of the sweet lust and pull of this situation. I said no and never hung out with them again.

Now that I was listening to God, was the devil giving me direct offers? For a long time, the devil had been non-existent to me, then he appeared as a vile torturer of souls, but now he had rematerialized as a kind, attractive and successful man dressed sharply in suit. Josh, you and I both know what is going on here. I imagined him saying. Let us respectfully drop all pretense. I am impressed by your efforts to evade me so far; it is quite commendable. Let us both be gentleman and as a token, let me offer you the best of my kingdom for free. Since this experience I have listened to dozens of Christian testimonies where people have said the devil appeared to them in dreams, or even as an apparition with these types of offers. Like any evil narcissist, as soon as the devil realizes you are not putting up with his abuse, he switches to love bombing you back into his clutches.

I now thank God for experiences like these. God was showing me that the coincidences or synchronicities in our lives can be set up by the devil. Like a recruiter for a cult or a gang, the devil pokes and prods and tests the limits of each person’s conscience and will so he can find whatever way he can to get us to slip up just once and suck us as far into the snares of hell as he can.

The path to hell starts with flattery, a delicious treat, and a dare. All of us have, or will, fall at least once for one of these tricks. Then, when we are faced with the chaos our decisions cause, we drown ourselves in even more hedonistic pleasure, trying to silence our conscience. Like an ant slipping into the burrow of an antlion, the more we thrash about in our lust and indulgence the more we feel spiritually dead and the less pleasure we feel. Beautiful food turns to ashes in our mouth and our dread grows at our impending fate.

# Chapter 39 – Heavenly Sign

In the New Testament, the Greek word ἀστήρ (aster) is translated “star” in English. While the word is used to describe distant gaseous fireballs, it is also used in the same way we use it today: to refer to a guiding object. But to ancient people, the word aster could also be used of a divine sign in the sky... and I was about to learn why.

My phone vibrated.  I looked down to see a text from a good friend at work, inviting me out. I quickly gathered my things, making sure to grab a jacket due to the bipolar Swedish weather. Several of us were meeting up at one of our favorite dives near the Spotify office, a restaurant during the day that turned into a club vibe at night. We loved this cheesy place. As usual, lots of hip people and pretty girls sauntered in and we ordered our stor stark (large strong) beers.

As we sipped on our drinks and joked about work relationships and dating, my mind kept wandering back to supernatural things. I could not shake this dreadful feeling that underneath all the glamourous nightlife and “safe” Swedish culture there were sinister demonic beings at work. The lust and anticipation at maybe meeting a woman and getting a one-night stand was fading quickly.

I had once chased this life and seen it as an end, trying to get another dopamine hit from a cool networking connection or a potential love interest. But now I knew this was not only empty, but demons wanted me to live a vacuous life like this. I felt out of place, like I had awakened from a dream. So much of the glitz and glamour felt like a trap. I could not unsee people flirting with temptation, people attempting to cheat on their partners, angry people flippantly telling others to go to hell, and yet others wantonly indulging in alcohol to salve the wounds caused by human selfishness.

A year before, I had no thoughts of spiritual things, no thoughts of angelic or demonic beings, and absolutely no interest in some “deeper” meaning behind life. It felt like my supernatural experiences had thrown a wet blanket on every dream I had chased. Or was it that a light had been shown on a demonic trap? My heart ached so deeply and intensely. Gone was the pure pleasure and innocent bliss of those early days upon arriving in Sweden. Sometimes I wished I could go back, but you cannot unsee the truth.

Yes, I wanted to know the truth – I truly did – but what was it going to cost? How far would this rabbit hole descend? Once you learn some truths, it is impossible to forget. Some people choose ignorance. But if there is an afterlife, then choosing ignorance today just pushes off the inevitable. It is better to start investing late than never.

While I sipped my beer, I contemplated how much to tell my friends. I felt like a split person. On the one hand I was this rational, intellectual mind that was still uncertain about what I was experiencing. Scientifically, I need more proof. On the other hand, deep in the depths of my soul I knew that something akin to heaven was working in my life. So I timidly began dipping into spiritual topics with friends but was mostly testing the waters while I was trying to figure things out. Surprisingly, I did not consider myself a Christian at this point. I needed to be even more certain of the direction I was headed, because becoming a devout Christian with supernatural experiences could cost me nearly everything I had worked for in Sweden.

One night I got home late after being with friends and I sauntered out onto my balcony to smoke a cigarette. The sky was bright blue and there was not a cloud in the sky. I could hear laughing Swedish voices in the distance. People were enjoying the long summer days across the neighborhood. It was a beautiful, long Swedish evening. The sun would go down around midnight.

Across from my apartment something caught my eye. Above a building across the courtyard was a bright pinpoint of light in the blue sky. It did not twinkle. It was a fixed point of bright white light larger than any star I had ever seen. And it was moving. I could see it drifting to the east above the fixed rooftop of the building below it.

But within a few seconds of my eyes focusing on it, in one smooth linear motion it vanished. I searched to no avail. The object disappeared. The whole thing must have lasted less than 10 seconds. I was dumbfounded.

I scanned the area around where it disappeared for the next couple of minutes. It never reappeared. There was no aircraft fuselage, no airplane contrail, nor anything else in the sky. The light hovered just long enough for me to get one good look at it and then it was gone. Was I imagining things?

A week or so later I saw the exact same thing again: a bright white light, slightly moving, that disappeared immediately when I looked at it. A disturbing sensation arose within my soul when I saw it, like the feeling I had in the park when I saw the two silver objects with Jason.

Were these “UFO” sightings all connected to what I was experiencing? I certainly had no way to prove they were. Perhaps I just so happened to be looking at the sky at the right moment to see a natural phenomenon, multiple times in a row, and now I was seeing what I wanted to see? No, that does not make sense! Jason saw it with me that first day. This cannot just be in my head.

These repeated experiences drove me to furiously study UFO phenomena. You might remember that shortly before becoming an atheist I had done some study on UFO phenomena but had rejected all of it as hysteria.

What did UFOs have to do with Christian themes? My confusion increased.  I considered myself a decent software engineer and had a strong grasp of algorithms and science. But this riddle baffled me. What could it possibly mean that I have experienced a ghost, prophecy, demons, angels, and now UFOs? And if any part of Christianity is true, what in the world does this have to do with a nondescript moving star in the sky?

I was certainly not trying to summon these events. I had never once done a Ouija board or visited anything remotely like a séance. My twenties were spent running away from anything or anyone connected with a belief in these things. I spent countless hours studying scientific topics to debunk anything related to religion and paranormal topics. I did not want any of this to be happening to me! Yet here I was, faced with nearly a dozen instances of supernatural and paranormal events. They all seemed loosely connected, but I was failing to make sense as to how. I wanted nothing to do with this!

What if the wrong coworkers found out that these things were happening to me. Would it end my career? What would I lose if people started to think I was crazy? Sweden, one of the most atheistic and anti-religion countries in Europe, was the worst place for this to happen! Who could I even talk to about what was happening? Most people would assume that I was just mentally ill, without even bothering to review the data.

I studied UFOs intently, carefully analyzing hundreds of witness accounts. In early 2019, all information about UFOs was mired in controversy and mocked. Sifting through available data and stories was a slog, because so much information was from sketchy sources and oftentimes the sightings or experiences contradicted each other. For every famous story, there were dozens of experts “debunking” it. But just like the ghost at the house or the demonic presence, I was no longer just a researcher. I was an experiencer. As I explored hundreds of UFO stories, I made several important discoveries about the people (dubbed experiencers) and what they observed.

First, there are numerous detailed reports of UFOs that defy any known explanation. Many reports involve multiple eyewitnesses and radar tracking on multiple systems, indicating that these events are not just in a person’s mind. Eyewitnesses who were on completely different areas of the ground and knew nothing of each other would often report seeing the same thing in the same spot, with a craft of some sort that moves in a way that defies gravity and any known propulsion system. Reports go back to ancient times, to the Middle Ages, the Romans, and of course Biblical accounts. Government projects do not account for the stories.

Second, while there are reports of physical nuts-and-bolts craft, I was fascinated that so many of the reports link UFOs to psychic phenomena. Some people report that the beings in the craft can communicate telepathically. In one of my favorite stories, Gary Steerman reports that he was flying in Texas and some UFO beings telepathically communicated to him through his radio headset from a typical saucer-shaped UFO . In many cases, like in Gary’s, the messages are benign. But in others the messages are about how humans need to love each other and how we are evolving upwards or need to take better care of our planet. A common belief among experiencers is that all religions are connected to these beings in these crafts, even Christianity. This idea is the source of many new age beliefs. From this theory we get thematic teaching that all religions contain the same core truth, and these beings are hovering above us guiding humanity upwards toward a bright awakening. This sounds fantastic but sadly is only half the story.

Another narrative arc across UFO accounts is deception and confusion. I personally found it impossible to listen to a dozen randomly selected UFO stories and develop a consistent theory about the phenomena that fit all the reported data. In many cases UFO beings communicate information to people that directly contradicts things they said previously! There are some stories of UFO beings outright lying to people and driving them insane. Carl Jung tackled UFOs  in a book late in his life and told a traumatic story of a young man who was convinced by a flying orb that he was a special messenger to the world and the beings gave him a promise they never kept. The young man went insane.

Even more disturbing, there are lots of bizarre UFO reports involving a morbid fascination with human reproduction and even torture. Numerous women have claimed to have been impregnated by these beings, and then later reported they were abducted, and the fetus was taken. There are numerous stories of aliens abducting and torturing people and animals, sucking the blood out of living victims, and dropping mutilated corpses in ranch fields. Some stories are downright terrifying to listen to and feel more like hellish demons than a technically savvy race of beings from another planet trying to lead us into the light. 

After their experience, many people suppress the memory out of shock and keep silent for fear of ridicule. This fear is quite understandable, for both the religious and non-religious. Most religious people are taught the universe is broken into spiritual and physical realms. When these realms do intersect, they are taught it is through dreams and visions and miracles but not through a physical piece of technology! The idea that angels might also by physical beings is disturbing to many. Likewise, the non-religious are usually taught that all life stems from evolution and that if life exists on other planets there is no way it could ever reach earth within the constraints of known physics. In short, the majority of both the religious and non-religious crowd are taught that these experiences are impossible. The implication is that anyone having a UFO experience is delusional. Naturally, many people stay silent or wait until their deathbed to reveal what they experienced.

As I consumed story after story of people who had interactions with UFOs, I became more dumbfounded. It seemed impossible that these stories of technological saucer-shaped craft existed in the same universe where a man like Padre Pio received the supernatural wounds of Christ in his hands and feet.

And yet, time after time I was reminded of stories in the Bible of strange objects in the sky or of floating orbs. The author of Genesis said that stars were for signs and seasons. Abraham observed a glowing orb float between two halves of a sacrificed cow as a sign of a covenant with God. The entire Hebrew nation followed a floating object that looked glowed at night and hovered silently during the day like a cloud for years. Ezekiel said he saw strange objects in the sky during one of his visions. It appears that within Judeo-Christianity, direction from heaven is often accompanied by heavenly signs and strange unidentified flying objects.

I do not know how many times I saw this starlike object that summer, but it must have been at least half a dozen. Eventually, I became used to seeing it and grew comforted at the fact I felt watched. Someone or something knew what I was going through. Whenever the darkness was thickest in my soul, I took comfort in knowing I was being observed by some beings that cared about my wellbeing. But how could I possibly know that I was not hallucinating or losing my mind? Like that young man Carl Jung spoke about, maybe some twisted heavenly visitors were just messing with me?

At my 35th birthday party in Stockholm in February of 2019, I had one of the best birthday parties of my life. I met a woman at this party, and we hit it off. She was smart, outgoing, and funny and we went on a date or two. On the surface she was the exact type of atheist woman that I wanted to be with when I originally moved to Sweden. She was working in biology for a large company, was an extremely confident atheist, and was great to converse with about every topic. Should I reveal to her I now believed in God and was having these supernatural experiences? Conflicted, I kept my mouth shut.

After about a month, I broke things off with her giving her a vague reason because I was uncertain how to talk about what was happening to me and was deeply emotional conflicted. She was sympathetic, and we agreed to continue being friends.

One night later in the summer we agreed to meet up for drinks to catch up. We had a few beers and at one point she was brutally transparent with me. She explained some personal things that to my awakened mind sounded deeply spiritual. Her situation reminded me of my discovery of dark demonic forces being involved in my life. I had no idea what to say.

As I got off the bus to walk to my apartment, I could not stop thinking about what she said. It scared me to think that my friend was dealing with something that might be demonic. I still remember the cool evening air as I walked past the small park behind my building. I looked up to the sky and prayed God, I don’t know how to pray for my friend, but I know she needs help. What do I pray for?

A single word response was shouted into my spirit: Deliverance! I wrote the following entry in my journal that evening:

It feels that God wants me to be some sort of a friend or influence [to her], but I really don’t understand the extent. Last night she told me she …had the worst week of her life. On the way home I asked God what I should be praying for her, and I just got one word: deliverance. Not sure what this means or what she needs deliverance from yet, but that’s what I’m doing.

I had no clue that this single journal entry was going to be a clue to help me solve the riddle of this star in the sky.

# Chapter 40 – Deliverance

Earlier in the summer of 2019 I attended Mass for the first time in Stockholm. As you might recall, my first friend in Stockholm was named Maria and was Catholic. After learning about Padre Pio, I had long contemplated going to mass with her, but I repeatedly chickened out.

One Sunday afternoon I remember waffling on whether to go and it felt like an angel dragged me to church. Without any warning, at the last minute I looked down and my feet started moving. It was like an out of body experience, watching myself put on my coat and shoes and walk out my front door to go to church. I felt like a little kid going limp while their annoyed parent literally picks them up to move them where they need to go.

A small amount of adrenaline pumped through my system as I rounded the corner to go to St. Eugenia’s church. This would be the first time I willingly went to a church service in earnest in nearly ten years. As I approached the door of the church, I felt a window to the spiritual realm crack open and sensed the presence of angels singing. A wave of embarrassment rushed over me. The verse came to mind “just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” (Luke 15:10)

After mass we went to lunch, and I opened about some of the spiritual things I had begun experiencing. Maria was instantly concerned when I mentioned the demonic things going on in my apartment. She offered me her Rosary and I accepted. While I was still a skeptic about everything related to Catholicism, I was keenly aware that God was placing things in my path to guide me and so I was open to trying it.

Knowing nothing about “proper” use of a Rosary, I began wearing it around my neck or hanging it in plain sight in my room at night – especially while sleeping and when I felt the dark presence. As already discussed, I would pray a lot, terrified to go to sleep because of the cacophony of demonic thoughts and sensation of presence that would regularly occur. At first, I was not sure if – or how - it was helping. If any of what was happening to me was real, I wanted to put a signal in my room that I was aligning myself with whatever Jesus wanted.

While I was extremely open to the idea that Jesus was important, the idea of Jesus dying and rising from the dead made no sense to me. The idea that He had to die to somehow pay for my sins was absurd. How could a punishment be transferred, and how did this save anyone?

I now knew that demonic beings want to trap or enslave people. And somehow, we fall into their traps when they deceive us to do bad things. This was confirmed by many near death experiences of people who got near or went to hell. They report that demons or evil humans in hell rage at them after they begin to turn toward God . As the stories go, demons say things like “we had you!” or “you were ours!”  I also felt strongly that this was a primary theme of the dream I had as a child with the white line in the park and the devil who came to grab me after I crossed it.

I had been given the word deliverance, but I was perplexed as to what that meant. Obviously, God was implying to pray for deliverance from demons, but what means, or mechanism could achieve this? And how would simply pushing a prayer upward toward heaven have any effect?

I had grown up with a simplified story of Jesus. In that version, we do bad things, and God must punish someone, so He sent Himself as Jesus and then punished Himself instead of us. This seemed illogical, archaic, and deeply unintelligent. I could not for the life of me see how Jesus connected to all these strange paranormal experiences I and everyone else was having! It made zero sense that Jesus dying and rising from the dead fixed anything.

Honestly, it made far more sense in my mind at this point that Jesus was chosen by some interdimensional beings as a special human to teach mankind. I was leaning into the idea that some interdimensional beings were visiting mankind through history and using paranormal experiences to push human thinking in a direction they wanted. Maybe supernatural experiences are artificially created to influence us.  Whether good and bad, maybe these experiences are a way for our genius watchers to draw attention to certain people or to create stories to stimulate our imaginations and influence human history. Maybe all the “revelations” in Christianity were just archaic messages that no longer matter in our “modern” world and perhaps Jesus was just an experiment they used to try and influence human history? This would explain why UFO reports include metallic craft, advanced technology, and why these beings are experimenting with human reproduction.

Regardless, this discovery of a connection between unidentified flying things and spiritual experiences rattled me to my core. On the one hand, I loved that maybe I was a participant in what appeared to be an extraordinary interaction from non-human messengers. On the other, there were countless stories of people being deceived by beings from the sky and I hated the idea I might be used like a rat in an experiment. Regardless of the explanation, I also was becoming overwhelmingly aware that what was happening to me was going to lead to disbelief and ridicule among both the religious and non-religious. This set of experiences flew in the face of most of organized belief systems. I was scared. What proof could I have that God was involved and that this was not just an experiment by some aliens?

Remember the photo of the contrail shadow? That day had perplexed me. A few minutes before I saw that shadow, Jason and I had seen the strange silver objects flying through the sky. It made sense now that this was the first time I had seen the UFOs, and Jason was meant to be there as a witness. But why was I shown that shadow contrail?

After much thought I realized the contrail shadow was a natural phenomenon that is super rare and impossible to predict far in advance. Yes, the silver objects gotten the attention of both Jason and me. But their appearance and our meeting were perfectly timed to see a rare natural phenomenon. Whatever Being was coordinating my supernatural or paranormal experiences was able to predict how airplane patterns line up with weather far in advance. This Being was able to coordinate my meeting with a friend, my meeting with Rodney, and even dreams far in advance. These experiences went far beyond an experiment by some aliens; this was more profound. Whatever was coordinating all this together had planned this far in advance, even back to at least when I was a child. And what Being can possibly know the future that well and coordinate all these events so perfectly?

Despite this, as I thought about the moving star I had repeatedly seen in the sky, I was increasingly frustrated at my inability to determine its meaning. It certainly was not a giant fireball from hundreds of lightyears away. And it certainly did not appear to be anything manmade. But what if I was making the same mistake we did as a kid at that campground in Guadalupe Mountains and it was just a natural phenomenon?

Due to so many people mistakenly calling natural phenomena a “UFO”, many recommend a test called The Five Observables if one has a hard time determining if they are seeing a real UFO or not. You can easily search for this list online. In short, each of the five observables looks for an action in a sky object that defies known physics or technology. If you see an object in the sky perform an action that fits the five observables, then you know it is not manmade or a known natural phenomenon.

One day near the end of summer I was walking home from the train, and I confidently reassured myself that it was unintelligent to believe that this star-like object in the sky was a being communicating with me. I will not believe this thing is a real UFO unless it moves in an extraordinary way, I thought silently, remembering the Five Observables.

Shortly after, I was out on my balcony and there it was again to the north: the star-like thing, floating gently in the sky, bright as ever. It gently hovered to its right and – just as it had many times before – a few seconds after I focused my eyes on it, it disappeared. This was nothing new and did not fit the five observables. I looked back at the courtyard, taking a drag on a cigarette, deep in thought.

Something pressed me, and I looked back at where it had been. There it was again! It had never appeared twice in a short time. Again, it disappeared a few seconds after I looked at it. I stared in disbelief.

Then, I saw it for a third time. And this time what it did gave me full-body goosebumps. It accelerated from a near-standstill to the fastest I have ever seen an object fly. It appeared to be accelerating at an angle toward the ground miles away. My best guess is that it began accelerating a couple miles away and about 20 degrees above the horizon. The entire process of accelerating downward and out of sight took no more than 2 seconds. No sonic boom was heard. It was now clearly defying physics.

Not only was I seeing a real UFO performing more than one of the five observables, but it did not move like this until after I had silently made my decision. Whatever was in control of this orblike thing was responding to my private thoughts. But what did this mean?

Several days later, I was pacing in my apartment trying to unravel the mystery of this star in the sky and what it must mean. I was in my mind scanning the hundreds of stories that I had consumed about UFO and paranormal experiences, trying to look for a pattern of any sort that might make sense of what was happening. I could not think of a story where someone was repeatedly experiencing a starlike thing in the sky while they were dealing with spiritual upheaval down below.

With a sudden shock, I stopped pacing and realized I did know a story. Everyone knows the story. We put a symbol of it on top of every Christmas tree every year. The magi followed a moving starlike object in the sky that led them to where Jesus lay. They were so overwhelmed with faith they brought Mary, Joseph, and the young Jesus gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.

Oh, you must be kidding me. I swore. I laughed. Filled with fear and surprise, I instantly knew what this meant, and every fiber of my will stood against it. Was I supposed to follow this star in the sky?

Quickly, I sat down at my laptop and looked up the Biblical story and reread it. I had read it a dozen times before, but this time was different because I was maybe experiencing something that had not happened in nearly 2000 years:

“After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.” When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.

When he had called together all the people’s chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born. “In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written:
	“‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
    		are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;
	for out of you will come a ruler
    		who will shepherd my people Israel.’”

Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”

After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.

When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. 

On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.” Matthew 2:1-12 (Berean Standard Bible)

Growing up, I had been led to believe that this might have been a normal star. Some scholars have deduced with the help of astronomical modeling that perhaps there was an alignment of multiple real stars to a single location in the sky that gave the illusion of one giant star. This had never made sense to me, however, because how could you possibly determine what portion of the ground a star is over? Plus, the earth rotates, so the location over which the star would be positioned would change every minute! This explanation had never made sense to me. As an atheist I thought this story was just a myth to prop up Christianity.

However, I now had personal evidence that there was another – stranger and more profound – explanation. The magi had followed a supernatural sign in the sky. The Greek text made it clear that what the magi saw appeared, moved, rose, went ahead, and stopped. This was no ordinary star.

The star also clearly disappeared while the magi were in Jerusalem, because Herod did not see it. Instead, Herod had to inquire from the magi when it first appeared, indicating that nobody among all of Herod’s experts had seen it appear either. Clearly this thing in the sky was selectively appearing to the magi and hiding itself from others. Perhaps this explained why I could not find any reports online of what I was seeing over Stockholm.

After the magi left Jerusalem, this sentence reveals the star reappeared:

When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.

The appearances of this star were intelligent and intentional. Just like with what I was experiencing.

I was so scared. I could not comprehend the significance of what was happening. It seemed that God or something wanted me to follow this thing in the sky. But I did not know where it had gone.

I prayed: God or my angel, whoever is listening, if I am supposed to follow you, please do it again. I wanted a second confirmation and to see it move in a way I could follow it.

Soon after, I was out on my balcony again, and this time I was eagerly scanning the sky. For quite some time, I saw nothing. Frustrated, I began doubting everything. With a sigh of resignation, I turned to go inside. The exact moment that I gave up and turned, I saw it appear in a new location and shoot across the sky across the horizon.

I could clearly see where it had gone. Across from my apartment a few blocks away a crane had been set up for construction, and this starlike thing dove directly in front of the tip of the crane so that I had a solid marker on the horizon of the direction it had gone.

Trembling, I grabbed my phone and opened maps to begin scrolling in that direction. At the time I lived on Elektravagen street in the neighborhood of Midsommarkransen. I scrolled up about 15 or 20 degrees west of north, searching. I scrolled, and scrolled, scanning everything in that direction. Everything was in Swedish, and unfortunately my Swedish was quite rough, so nothing stood out.

Then there it was, in English, the two words New Life.

I stared in surprise and skepticism at these two English words on my Google Maps screen. I clicked it. It was an English-speaking Christian church. This had to be a cosmic joke or a coincidence, there was no way that one of the most important moments in my life would be marked by the words New Life.

Doubtful, I scrolled further on the map for quite a ways but nothing else stood out. That church was the only thing in the path that was remotely related. With a sigh, I knew that I needed to go.

Early that Sunday morning I woke up and took the trains to the location of New Life church in Alvik, Sweden. I was full of anticipation, but uncertain what to expect. How could I possibly know I went to the right location?

Upon arrival there were the usual formalities. I distinctly remember my embarrassment when they asked everyone who was a guest to raise their hands. I raised mine, and they handed me a welcome card. The person up front said they wanted to hear afterwards what brought us to church that Sunday. The idea of telling them that I followed a star in the sky was too much. Plus, I still had no definitive proof that I had come to the right place. I needed another sign.

After some worship songs and a greeting period, a traveling guest pastor named Jim went up to speak. He said he was going to be speaking on spiritual warfare. I felt adrenaline increase. I had been to thousands of church services, and a Sunday morning service about spiritual warfare was unusual and too on the nose given my experiences.

He talked about the connections between a person’s spiritual state and open doors to the demonic realm by which they can begin tormenting us. This seemed at the time to be completely unrelated to me. What did this have to do with my experiences? I had never done any witchcraft, and I did not even believe in the supernatural a year before. But the memory of the demonic tormenting thoughts that had plagued my mind since earlier that year kept me listening.

Near the end of his sermon, he announced that he was going to be in Stockholm for the following three nights to do a special three-part series on spiritual warfare. My ears were tingling. Was I led to this church at this exact time to hear these exact messages?

That following night, Monday, September 30, 2019, I sheepishly returned to church. I was still uncertain I was at the right place and was highly suspicious and skeptical of everything that was said, but I felt compelled to go.

Pastor Jim again got up to give his first part of the spiritual warfare series. When he did, he flipped to his first slide and against a bright blue background was the single word in all capital letters: DELIVERANCE.

In a rush of emotions I cannot even explain, I felt like all of heaven was staring right at me. It felt like a roomful of angels was waiting with bated breath at my response. This was the sign. This was the word that I had written in my journal only a couple of weeks before:

On the way home I asked God what I should be praying for her, and I just got one word: deliverance. Not sure what this means…
	
For three evenings, Pastor Jim outlined one story after another of people being delivered from demonic influences in their lives. He detailed how people both willingly and unwillingly become ensnared by demonic influence. He explained how he had seen people with connections to demons from birth through family ties with secret societies and rituals and how some people become oppressed through unforgiveness and bitterness or unconfessed sin. He talked about how immoral sexual relationships can lead to demonic oppression, and about how much witchcraft is still actively at work in the world.

The entire time, despite all the evidence, my old atheist intellect was in shock and disbelief. This could not be true! None of this debunked the evidence I had learned year after year against Christianity. If I had not been led supernaturally to listen to this sermon series, I would have never accepted a word that was said!

But this was no ordinary visit. I was at this church as the culmination of a series of supernatural events that I had followed like breadcrumbs. Something more powerful, wiser, and with complete vision into my life had led me to this moment at this church listening to this man. These sermons were not just intriguing, they were deeply relevant. They might even be essential. I was dealing with at least one demonic being in my life, and knowing how to be delivered was my number one priority.

Jim spoke about how demons are territorial, and they trick us into giving up as much of our space and soul to their possession. They see souls, land, and things as territory to be conquered and held. And they twist and bargain and claw their way into as much control over our lives as possible. Christ accomplished the main task to be delivered, but now we must accept it and then work with heaven to clean up our lives from the devil’s influence and control. Exorcising demonic influence from our lives may be extremely difficult, but God already won his side of the battle, so with His help we can succeed.

After the series, Jim returned to Portugal. I told a few of the church leaders about what was happening and then invited a couple of the elders to my apartment for prayer. I told them my story, we prayed, and I confessed sins. At this point, there was no point in hiding anything. I just wanted to make sure that whatever happened that my life was now aligned with Christ and against whatever those things were that were haunting me. The following weeks I confessed as many sins as I possibly could to God, and I began begging God to show me all the areas in my life where I may have allowed in demonic influence. I was brutally frank with God about my continued doubts and questions about Christianity, but I did my best to obey when I felt He was leading me.

Jesus’ death and resurrection started to make some sense. It might be helpful to reread chapter 3, which I truly believe was a dream from God to help us understand redemption. Best I understand, the universe is like a garden to God and left by itself it falls into chaos, so God is in a constant state of supervision and creation. God desires order, peace, joy, and everything good and wants his conscious creatures to pursue this. By doing this, we are active participants in maintaining creation. Demonic spirits have aligned their will against God and desire only increased chaos, torture, and suffering. We are born into this chaotic world as a test to see if, left alone with our lust and suffering, we will pursue God and the good or love wickedness. The devil and demons play the role of being our opposers, and being the purest form of narcissists, wants to suck all attention and energy toward themselves and cause us to fall into a life that leads to increased chaos and suffering. The devils may offer every pleasure the world has, but despite their bait, their intent is always to injure, to steal, to destroy. The devil love-bombs to get what he wants and then discards his victim’s empty soul to find his next source of supply. Demons can coordinate their human minions like puppets to help push their plan. Demons become furious when someone wises up to their tricks. God has set life up so that we can never find the narrow escape through our intellect alone, but it only begins when we shift our will in humility toward Him. When we shift our will that direction, all of heaven coordinates to help that person be delivered from the devil’s snares.

Because humans have followed numerous lies to pursue selfish lives, God has given over a large chunk of this world to demonic beings, even churches. Jesus said the devil is the “god of this world”. He condemned the self-righteous religious leaders of his day, who in jealousy ended up handing him over to death. The devil does not care which deception causes people to give him his narcissistic fix, he just wants each of us humans to fall for one of his lies. That lie could be found in atheism or a religious sect. The devil wants our will to be against whatever God wants. With each soul that the devil can get to participate in his plans, he gains power. The devil’s kingdom grows with each person who turns against God’s will. Even if the person does not worship the devil directly, when they believe a demonic lie, this props up the devil’s ego and furthers the devil’s plans. Anything that hinders God’s will enables the devil’s kingdom. None of us are innocent bystanders in this cosmic war. We may try to stand on the sidelines, but if we are not helping God, we are encouraging God’s enemy.

How does sacrifice play into this? I define a sacrifice as giving up something you love deeply for a higher purpose. When we sacrifice something, we perform an act of subservience to a cause. We symbolically give worth toward (worship) that cause or being. We do acts of subservience to communicate that we want our will to be aligned or in harmony with someone else’s will. The word “righteous” in Hebrew means “to be in harmonious relationship with”. A sacrifice is our proof that we want to have a righteous relationship with someone.

One could lie about our intentions, even to ourselves, therefore the only way to prove our intentions is to sacrifice something you love for the cause. God and the devil use sacrifices to measure the alignment of our will. Talk is cheap, but if you sacrifice something you love the most then you prove your true motives. Imagine you only have one of a thing and it is the thing you love the most and you sacrifice it. Because you can only sacrifice it once and toward one purpose, you are proving your undivided devotion to that purpose. You cannot sacrifice your favorite cow twice! Admitting fault can be a type of sacrifice, because we sacrifice our pride to show our devotion to the truth. Another form of a sacrifice would be to permanently give up something that you possess that is of great value, like a prized breeding sheep. The greatest form of a sacrifice would, naturally, be to give up your own life. You can only do that once.

After much wrestling, God had wanted me to prove that I was now aligning my will with His and He gave me a leap of faith. He wanted this hardened atheist to follow a supernatural star to a church – the most absurd and humiliating thing I had ever done in my life. I risked and sacrificed my intellectual pride and my reputation as an atheist when I went to that church.

But what sacrifice had God given to prove to us that he is devoted to our well-being and wants a harmonious relationship? It was the very same gift that the star represented, Jesus Christ, His only unique son (John 3:16). God sees each of us that fall into the devil’s snares and actively chose to start the relationship. Jesus made the biggest sacrifice, his life, to prove his intentions. Through a spiritual mystery our intellect cannot comprehend, Jesus came in the flesh to show us now to live and that he wanted to rescue us and then in one final sacrifice gave Himself over to the devil and took our place. Like my dream in chapter 3 had demonstrated, Jesus’ sacrifice was both a ransom to the devil for the right to rescue our souls and a proof of goodwill toward mankind that He wants a righteous (harmonious) relationship with us. Jesus’ death is itself the thing, then, that washes away our active acts of participation in the devil’s works. And Jesus’ resurrection is proof that our future will be life if we accept the outstretched hand of deliverance.

I gave my life wholeheartedly to God. I was keenly aware that this was just the beginning. I knew the devil was not going to back down. The primary hold on my life may have been severed, but that did not mean Satan was still not going to try and ruin me or slow me down!

At the end of 2019, I knew deep down that I had been saved from the worst. I never saw that star again, and I looked many times. God saw how deceived and lost I was, pursued me, and rescued me. He loves me. Jesus and his angels had stepped into my life and rescued me from the pits of hell. They had rescued me from suicidal thoughts, from overwhelmingly dark internal voices, from the existential dread of a life without an external purpose or meaning. God wanted me to experience and then write this story because He loves you and wants to deliver you too.

My name is Joshua, which is the Hebrew equivalent of Jesus. My name, and the name Jesus, both literally mean God is deliverance. God chose that attribute as His earthly name, to describe His goal for mankind. I could barely comprehend that God had designed a story for my life where the climax was the meaning of my name. The endless hell, heartache, loss and confusion I had experienced were all now being wrapped up into a story with a cute bow, like a gift from above.

That aching feeling you have in your chest is God calling to you, pleading with you to let Him rescue you from the traps the devil has laid in your life. He wants to garden your chaotic soul and turn all its overgrown and hellish corners into light and beauty. He wants to give you peace! That overwhelming tug on your soul is the sign that you do not need intellectual answers right now, you need your soul rescued. Give your soul to God. Pray right now, asking for deliverance. We will have all of eternity to explore and learn about the universes God has created.

May God bless this story that He has woven into my life by pushing you to repentance and opening your eyes. There is no greater thing a person can do than give their life with abandon to God and His plans.

In the Bible, the number 40 is repeatedly a symbol of trial and testing. As I write this, I finish my 40th year on this planet, and I unintentionally finish this most important 40th chapter.

# Chapter 41 – New Life

I felt immediately compelled by God to write the main points of the story down while it was fresh in my memory. I also felt compelled to reverse some of the damage I did while telling everyone Christianity was not true. I wrote a quick version and sent it out to some of my close friends and family, confessing my return to Christianity. I was humiliated. I knew that I was opening myself up to potential ridicule, but this was the right thing to do.

I wish that the initial deliverance by God led to a happily ever after story, but the reality is that full spiritual deliverance can take a long time and the battle was only beginning. Knowing full well that Jesus had done the hardest part by sacrificing His life for me and breaking the chains on my life, I was now responsible to direct my will toward Him and His kingdom and walk away from the devil’s lies. Like a bird that has been trapped in a cage, someone can open the door but you still have to learn to fly again. Not only did I need deliverance from my sinful ways, but I needed rescuing from the multiple demonic beings that had schemed to destroy my life.

At one point a couple weeks after visiting New Life and getting prayer from the ministry team, I noticed a spiritual peace in my apartment. Gone were the constant harassing voices telling me to end myself, that they would kill me, that I was worthless, and that I would amount to nothing. My apartment felt calmer. Knowing full well the devil does not give up easily, I prayed asking where the devil and the forces against me had gone. A gentle voice whispered, it went external.

Within days, my coworker at the small startup I had joined ominously pulled me aside at work for lunch saying he wanted to discuss something. It was a beautiful sunny day in Stockholm at the restaurant where we both sat outside at a small table alone. Without hesitation, he shared with me that he thought our managers were engaging in fraud. He laid out some notes he had been taking showing that the financial numbers we were given by the CEO did not make sense. He confidently declared we should ask our CEO to see the financial books. If our CEO got angry, we knew there was something fishy. My coworker then blatantly suggested that if we discovered fraud, we should ask to take a cut of the money to stay silent. I sat in shock and told him directly that I would never do such a thing. He looked at me and mumbled “you’re a good man Josh…” and looked away deep in thought.

When we asked to see the financial books, our CEO became livid, declaring that the Chief Financial Officer from our investors had also asked to see the books. We were not the only ones that suspected something!

Shortly after, my coworker’s behavior rapidly changed. He suddenly was super good friends with the CEO. I felt the office vibe shift against me. I found myself thoroughly perplexed as to what was going on. I was so naïve.

One day as I paced my apartment praying, I heard a soft voice tell me Josh, they are going to fire you. I froze. Could this be true? Is this what “going external” meant? Instead of being attacked silently and internally, now demons were going to use others against me?

Shortly after, I sat working at a coffee shop with the same coworker, and while he acted as if it was just a normal day. My boss sent a message saying the owners wanted to meet with me. I turned to my coworker and confidently asked “did you get me fired?” He stared silently at his laptop screen, baffled as to how I figured it out.

They fired me, with a trumped up, long-winded explanation about health and thinking I was not a good fit. I had just been accepted as a full-time employee a few weeks before and in Sweden it is highly illegal to fire a full-time employee like this. I recorded the entire conversation.

My Swedish friends’ mother was an attorney and said that this was an open-and-shut case in my favor. I was told that my managers were hoping that because I was not a native Swede, I would not be able to navigate the law system. I hired a lawyer, and she assured me that I would win this battle. Unfortunately, I also discovered in Norway I was legally obligated to become a whistleblower to the investors about any potential fraud.

This was a nightmare. My anxiety was through the roof as I tried to navigate Swedish and Norwegian laws while barely knowing either language. My faith in God was paramount at this time, and I suspected this entire experience was the devil’s retribution for my conversion.

Due to a last-minute loophole my boss found, I lost the ensuing legal battle and about a year’s worth of savings. My lawyer was so furious she offered me pro-bono assistance if we spent a year in the court system fighting. The only catch was that I would be required to not quit the job so that I could prove I still wanted to work there. My boss was already assigning me boring and useless tasks to get me to quit, so I decided I had had enough. The devil may take his pound of flesh, but the main battle had already been won for my soul.

My friend Maria was so excited about my conversion to Christianity she connected me to her father. He had once been a rock-and-roll heathen. On our first phone call, he told me his story of becoming a Christian.

One night when in spiritual despair at his empty, partying life he had a miraculous encounter with an angel. The angel healed him of a lifelong issue with his jaw. The event was so powerful that when his girlfriend woke up the next day, she told him his face was glowing before he even had a chance to explain his vision. He converted to Christianity and was now a devout Catholic.

He then tells me – not knowing about my job situation – that immediately after his conversion he got severely demonically attacked. One of the women at his workplace was a self-declared witch and when he accepted Christ this witch accused him of horrible things that led to his getting fired and a lawsuit. He also lost the lawsuit! Then, like Judas, this woman kissed him on the cheek on the way out of the courtroom.

God had organized events once again to give me a reminder that what I was experiencing was indeed real. I have learned to take it as a good sign to be attacked by the devil as long as I am trying to do what is right: it means the kingdom of darkness finds you to be a problem and God considers you worthy.

As I write here on my couch in Austin, six years have past since that first visit to New Life church. An endless whirlwind of events could fill – and may fill – a second book. I imagine I could write a hundred stories of divine interaction but will wrap up this book by outlining some of the things God has taught me since.

One by one, God began to answer some of my questions about faith and His interaction with the universe. Most of the answers made me uncomfortable.  God began to show me that giving me answers to every question was ultimately not going to accomplish what He wanted. He was less concerned with me having the correct facts about the universe and more concerned with my spiritual healing and wholeness. There is an eternity to get answers to questions but walking with Jesus’ today is the most important thing. The Christian Walk means going where God directs us to go, especially when we do not understand what is happening. We cannot halt until we understand everything. God has had to remind me “focus on what is right before you, Josh”. God will handle the rest.

Regarding the numerous things within the Bible that caused me to leave the faith, God led me to multiple people that had a massive impact on me. The first was Howard Storm, who had a near-death experience in 1985 as an atheist. Howard went to a hellish place and then was rescued by Jesus, who answered many of his questions. Many of the questions Jesus answered were ones that I had. I highly recommend everyone read the book My Descent into Death by Howard Storm and watch his interviews.

Another big influence was the late Dr. Michael Heiser, who directly and repeatedly addressed the issues found in the Book of Enoch and how ancient people thought about the strange events surrounding the Nephilim and the Great Flood of Genesis. Heiser also spoke at length about how ancient people would have approached the text and it was radically different than our modern scientific understanding. Heiser and the answers that Jesus gave Howard Storm helped me to see that just because ancient people had a primitive understanding about our planet does not mean that the thematic goals of God are not still important. God’s goal is not to give each generation a complete understanding of the universe, but to help us to learn to love and follow Him despite having limited understanding. Our journey of knowledge and growth in those areas can continue without end when we exit this body. I may in a future book or podcast address these topics in detail if I feel led, but consider which has more weight, the arguments outlined in former chapters against Christianity or a heavenly star guiding me to a church and deliverance from demons? Regardless of any unresolved intellectual arguments, I had to trust what God had shown me.

In 2022, I moved to Austin to be nearer to my sister. We were intrigued about the event that occurred when I was twelve in Kansas City at the funeral. You may remember the “evil” man appeared to telepathically hear my thoughts. We discovered something shocking.

The young woman who was murdered in the cemetery at the beginning of this book was Anastasia Witbols-Feugen. The murder occurred the week of Halloween in 1997, and within a few days of her murder the “high priest” of Satanism in the United States - Anton Lavey - died in controversy. Were Anastasia’s murder and satanism directly connected?

Anastasia’s funeral occurred a few days before Halloween of 1997 and was the first noticeable demonic experience in my life, after which I began to experience horrid demonic attacks in my room and severe depression and anxiety. Around 10 years later I would read Anton Lavey’s Satanic Bible while at Moody Bible Institute. Shortly after, I would become an atheist, throwing off all spiritual beliefs. That was when I said my fateful prayer asking for evidence from the supernatural.

A few days before Halloween of 2017 – exactly 20 years after the funeral of Anastasia – I experienced the disembodied woman’s voice in the rented room in London. Two of the most profound supernatural experiences in my life were exactly 20 years apart on Halloween. This did not seem coincidental.

Early in 1997, I fully gave my life to Jesus and told Him that I was willing to do anything He wanted me to do. I was baptized on that Mother’s Day. Five months later, at Anastasia’s funeral, I was awakened for the first time to the demonic. Could it be that demonic beings noticed that I had a gift to see their presence, and decided to attack me directly?

Naturally, the demons harassed me through anxiety, depression, confusion, hopelessness, lies, and intimidation. I have learned from dozens of other Christian testimonies that a demonic presence of terror while alone is a common intimidation tactic. This tactic is outlined at the end of Job 4:
 
“A word was secretly brought to me,
    my ears caught a whisper of it.
Amid disquieting dreams in the night,
    when deep sleep falls on people,
fear and trembling seized me
    and made all my bones shake.
A spirit glided past my face,
    and the hair on my body stood on end.
It stopped,
    but I could not tell what it was.
A form stood before my eyes,
    and I heard a hushed voice:
 ‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God?
    Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker?
If God places no trust in his servants,
    if he charges his angels with error,
how much more those who live in houses of clay,
    whose foundations are in the dust,
    who are crushed more readily than a moth!
Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces;
    unnoticed, they perish forever.
Are not the cords of their tent pulled up,
    so that they die without wisdom?”

Job 4:1-21 (NIV)

My will at that time was against the kingdom of darkness, so they could not fully control me. They kept harassing for years until I was in utter despair. At this point, God granted me the dream about the wolf and gave me the message “no matter how far he goes, the devil is always on a chain.” This was clearly preparation for nearly fifteen years later.

The devil now needed to change tactics. Surely the devil himself knew that the dream was a Padre Pio quote, and that God was up to something. The devil, of course, also knew the rest of the quote. “The devil has only one door through which to enter into our soul; the will.” The devil needed to find some way to get me to will against God.

After that dream, the next strategy of the devil was getting me to act the religious part. After endless attempts to get an explanation from pastors, elders, and missionaries, I can remember the day I concluded that I should hide my anxiety attacks, my doubts, and the demonic presences that were so frequent.

To my surprise, this convinced everyone and even though I could regularly feel the demonic presences I was silent about them. I became an intellectual Christian and began to study vigorously.

While at Moody Bible Institute, convinced by the arguments, I became an atheist. Shortly after becoming an atheist, I had that curious and horrific nightmare where I was being filled with a demon from my toes upward. A demon was now in me, although he was still on a chain. Now, as the devil always does, he had to use me for his purposes and then discard me. But could the devil push me further?

I can remember one night out drinking with friends in Chicago. We met a male “friend”. At one point he pulls me aside from everyone else and says that there was a ritual séance that was happening later that night, and I was invited. He then tells me that at one of the rituals they sacrificed a prostitute. At the time, I was so in shock at what I was hearing I laughed and thought what he was saying was a joke or that he was trying to scare me. I laughed and brushed this off, he then disappeared, and I never saw him again.

The devil may not have been able to get me to embrace satanism, but he did push me to fully embrace atheism and a vocal hatred of religion and a full indulgence in lust. Because of this, I moved to Sweden in 2017. Then of course, Halloween of 2017 rolls around and that fateful voice gently asks me – twice – “Excuse me, sir?”

This was exactly 20 years after that first Halloween incident, and it is my current belief that most likely around Halloween of 1997 the devil was given a timeframe of 20 years during which to try to destroy me. God gave the devil limits – a chain – beyond which the devil could not go. Then in 2017, the 20-year time limit was up, and God began calling me back to faith. I cannot prove this is the case, but it is the only explanation that makes sense to me at this time.

Discovering all of this has pushed me to research and dig deep into studying the concept of deliverance from demons. I believe every part of the Church suffers immensely by ignoring this topic. Jesus showed up on the scene and immediately demons are challenging him and Jesus cast them out. Before Jesus returned to heaven, he declared that one of the signs of true Christians is that they would cast out devils. The church, often to appear intellectual, has not been listening to the Holy Spirit on these matters. As a result, even within church walls demons abuse and torment people seeking God. And many have fallen for the lie that demonic oppression is just mental illness. It is often not just mental illness; those horrid voices are often real interaction from demonic spirits! And the healing that people experience is often not just medical, but angelic.

Two final stories will demonstrate this and then this story will end.

By a twist of Providence, the construction crane in front of which the star had darted that final time was constructing the next building that I moved into. Half a year later, at that building I was struggling with a constant feeling of spirits in my room, trying every tactic to get me to give up or abandon Christianity.

One late night, as I lay alone in my bed staring at my phone, I thought in my mind only I should go turn out the lights and go to bed. At that very instant, a heard an audible click from my livingroom around the corner and saw the light go out. I was so in shock, I did not know what to do. My first thought was to check the fuse at the electrical box. As I got up, I heard in my spirit a little voice say see Josh, we just want to help you. I shook this off and opened the electrical box to see that every fuse was completely fine.

Turning around, I saw that not only was the main light in the living room off but the light switch was also now off. I walked over and tested it, and it worked perfectly.

Then, suddenly, I could feel something staring at me and goosebumps arose on my entire body. Something was in the room. I remembered the power of saying things in Jesus’ name. In ancient times, saying in the name of was a way to say something in their authority. Out loud to the room I said “I don’t know who you are or what you want, but if you have not come on the same mission that Jesus came to fulfill, I want you to leave!” Immediately, I felt a presence leave the room and when it did the entire lighting in the room shifted. A pattern of light on the ceiling reverted to normal. It was like whatever was in the room had left a residual effect on the lighting and environment, which is probably what I subconsciously detected that had caused my goosebumps. Whatever it was, it was certainly against Jesus, and it was now gone.

Shortly after this, I remember feeling a deep malaise. My life felt like a slow drudgery and despite telling many people about my story, I felt that I was just not doing enough as a Christian. I remember pleading one night with God to give me a sign that I was right where He wanted me to be, that I was still in his plan, because it felt like my life was moving so slowly.

The following day, I left my apartment as I had maybe a hundred times before. In Sweden, it is common for street names to be put onto a metal plaque on the sides of buildings. Many years before, a road had existed in front of my building, and its discarded plaque was still on the side of the building right in front of my apartment. The plaque was blackened with age, as corrosion had taken its toll and so I had never once noticed it. That morning, I exited my apartment just in time for the sun to shine a beam of brilliant gold onto that plaque and I noticed it for the first time. The old, abandoned street name directly in front of my new apartment had been Godsplan.

I truly hope this story offers hope to someone. You can feel the pull right now. Your soul is battling some unseen force and the fog of war is wrapped thick around you. Maybe nobody understands you and the darkness inside, not your parents, not your siblings, not your closest friends. Nobody truly loves you, and everything you are doing in life feels at first like a victory and then turns to ash. Even people who claim to be Christians have abused you. You feel hopeless and your pain and suffering appear to have no purpose. It appears that there is no justice in the world.

God sees you and loves you. He can put purpose into your suffering and give you eternal peace. God knows all, and He has a plan if you will just reach out for help. Pray. Commit your life to Him and set your will to do good, no matter how dark the desolations that overtake your soul. Give your life to Jesus Christ, fully, and to His kingdom and His righteousness and even though in this life you will face many trials, you will gain eternity.

God bless and keep you all.

“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.” Joshua 1:9
